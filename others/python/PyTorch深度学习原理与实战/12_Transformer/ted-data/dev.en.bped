__zh-cn__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__zh-cn__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__zh-cn__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__zh-cn__ A morning that I will never forget .
__zh-cn__ A real school .
__zh-cn__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__zh-cn__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__zh-cn__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__zh-cn__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__zh-cn__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__zh-cn__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__zh-cn__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__zh-cn__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__zh-cn__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__zh-cn__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__zh-cn__ Were we being followed ?
__zh-cn__ Do they know where we live ?
__zh-cn__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__zh-cn__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and daughters were treas@@ ured .
__zh-cn__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__zh-cn__ A total maver@@ ick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was diso@@ w@@ ned by his father .
__zh-cn__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__zh-cn__ There she is .
__zh-cn__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__zh-cn__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__zh-cn__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__zh-cn__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__zh-cn__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__zh-cn__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__zh-cn__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__zh-cn__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__zh-cn__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__zh-cn__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__zh-cn__ Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__zh-cn__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bury College .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__zh-cn__ He not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__zh-cn__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why I co@@ founded SO@@ LA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__zh-cn__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__zh-cn__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__zh-cn__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__zh-cn__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SO@@ LA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__zh-cn__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__zh-cn__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__zh-cn__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__zh-cn__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__zh-cn__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__zh-cn__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; with@@ draw@@ al .
__zh-cn__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__zh-cn__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SO@@ LA remind me of that .
__zh-cn__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have separated .
__zh-cn__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__zh-cn__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat se@@ eping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__zh-cn__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__zh-cn__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__zh-cn__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__zh-cn__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__zh-cn__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__zh-cn__ Then we get more personal with it .
__zh-cn__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__zh-cn__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__zh-cn__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__zh-cn__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__zh-cn__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__zh-cn__ I get it .
__zh-cn__ We are neuro@@ logically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__zh-cn__ We start forming cli@@ ques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__zh-cn__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__zh-cn__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__zh-cn__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__zh-cn__ The boxes are too narrow .
__zh-cn__ And this can get really dangerous .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s a dis@@ claim@@ er about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__zh-cn__ I grew up in a very shel@@ tered environment .
__zh-cn__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__zh-cn__ I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religi@@ ous@@ ly-@@ based upbringing .
__zh-cn__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weir@@ do .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) It was an un@@ orthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__zh-cn__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__zh-cn__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__zh-cn__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__zh-cn__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__zh-cn__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ I kept up the char@@ ade for eight years .
__zh-cn__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__zh-cn__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian S@@ later around and bad@@ g@@ ered him .
__zh-cn__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__zh-cn__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__zh-cn__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my cr@@ ot@@ ch to check what I was working with .
__zh-cn__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was pe@@ eing standing up .
__zh-cn__ At sle@@ epo@@ vers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genit@@ alia .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__zh-cn__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__zh-cn__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__zh-cn__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dy@@ sm@@ orphic and put me on hormones to sta@@ ve off puberty .
__zh-cn__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__zh-cn__ Pu@@ ber@@ ty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__zh-cn__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__zh-cn__ No one is exactly shocked .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__zh-cn__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__zh-cn__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ ash either .
__zh-cn__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very un@@ orthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__zh-cn__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__zh-cn__ So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ position 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__zh-cn__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__zh-cn__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ ni@@ shed civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blat@@ antly .
__zh-cn__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__zh-cn__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__zh-cn__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-@@ year personal identity crisis z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -com@@ pen@@ s@@ ating , boy@@ -c@@ ha@@ sing gir@@ ly-@@ girl to finally just a hes@@ itant exploration of what I actually was , a tom@@ boy@@ ish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__zh-cn__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of be@@ twe@@ en-@@ the-@@ lines — girls who skate@@ boarded but did it in l@@ acy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; hair@@ cuts but wore gir@@ ly nail polish , girls who had eyes@@ ha@@ dow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being bo@@ xed in to anything .
__zh-cn__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started lik@@ ening our love to b@@ esti@@ ality on national television .
__zh-cn__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__zh-cn__ I was legally and in@@ disp@@ ut@@ ably a second@@ -class citizen .
__zh-cn__ I was not an activist .
__zh-cn__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__zh-cn__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__zh-cn__ How could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__zh-cn__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__zh-cn__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__zh-cn__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__zh-cn__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second@@ -class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__zh-cn__ It might give them pause .
__zh-cn__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photograph@@ ically without any artif@@ ice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__zh-cn__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whis@@ kers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__zh-cn__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__zh-cn__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-@@ off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__zh-cn__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mu@@ g@@ shots if you will .
__zh-cn__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__zh-cn__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__zh-cn__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the H@@ RC and I asked them for some help .
__zh-cn__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__zh-cn__ And then we made this .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m i@@ O Til@@ lett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__zh-cn__ Self Evi@@ dent Tru@@ ths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__zh-cn__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__zh-cn__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__zh-cn__ We are failing as a nation to uph@@ old the morals upon which we were founded .
__zh-cn__ There is no equality in the United States .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ at every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__zh-cn__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__zh-cn__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__zh-cn__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__zh-cn__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__zh-cn__ I want to take the project across the country .
__zh-cn__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__zh-cn__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__zh-cn__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O Til@@ lett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__zh-cn__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__zh-cn__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__zh-cn__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__zh-cn__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__zh-cn__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__zh-cn__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__zh-cn__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-@@ town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__zh-cn__ Vi@@ sibility really is key .
__zh-cn__ Fam@@ ili@@ arity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__zh-cn__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__zh-cn__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern B@@ ap@@ tists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__zh-cn__ S@@ parking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evi@@ dent Tru@@ ths .
__zh-cn__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evi@@ dent Tru@@ ths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__zh-cn__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__zh-cn__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__zh-cn__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__zh-cn__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__zh-cn__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__zh-cn__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__zh-cn__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__zh-cn__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__zh-cn__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__zh-cn__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__zh-cn__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__zh-cn__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__zh-cn__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__zh-cn__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__zh-cn__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__zh-cn__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__zh-cn__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__zh-cn__ Where exactly does one become a second@@ -class citizen ?
__zh-cn__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__zh-cn__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jer@@ ks and sweethe@@ arts and Democrats and Republicans and j@@ oc@@ ks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__zh-cn__ A@@ side from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__zh-cn__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evi@@ dent Tru@@ ths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__zh-cn__ Hopefully these categories , these bin@@ aries , these over-@@ simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__zh-cn__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__zh-cn__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__zh-cn__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__zh-cn__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__zh-cn__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__zh-cn__ Am I the one that you choose to diso@@ wn as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s too late .
__zh-cn__ Because I already am all of those things .
__zh-cn__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__zh-cn__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__zh-cn__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__zh-cn__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__zh-cn__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cac@@ ophon@@ y of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__zh-cn__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tat@@ tered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__zh-cn__ When my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__zh-cn__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__zh-cn__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__zh-cn__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhi@@ bit@@ or at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__zh-cn__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__zh-cn__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__zh-cn__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atro@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__zh-cn__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__zh-cn__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__zh-cn__ O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before .
__zh-cn__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__zh-cn__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__zh-cn__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-@@ Atlantic slave trade .
__zh-cn__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__zh-cn__ That equ@@ ates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__zh-cn__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__zh-cn__ A@@ st@@ oni@@ shingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__zh-cn__ Many have been tr@@ icked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__zh-cn__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__zh-cn__ Sla@@ very exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__zh-cn__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kil@@ ns .
__zh-cn__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dan@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
__zh-cn__ En@@ vel@@ oped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ aked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scor@@ ching kil@@ ns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__zh-cn__ De@@ ad@@ ened by monot@@ ony and exhaus@@ tion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__zh-cn__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe de@@ hydration made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequential .
__zh-cn__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ce@@ ased working .
__zh-cn__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ iser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__zh-cn__ Back in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cry , but the aboli@@ tionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__zh-cn__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__zh-cn__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__zh-cn__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__zh-cn__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__zh-cn__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__zh-cn__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountain@@ ous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__zh-cn__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoist@@ ed them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__zh-cn__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__zh-cn__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__zh-cn__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__zh-cn__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the sla@@ ve@@ holders burned down all of their houses .
__zh-cn__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ allied for them to per@@ severe , and aboli@@ tionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-@@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__zh-cn__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__zh-cn__ In Kath@@ mand@@ u , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__zh-cn__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , di@@ mly fluorescent lit basement .
__zh-cn__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__zh-cn__ It was more like a restaurant .
__zh-cn__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__zh-cn__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__zh-cn__ Each cubicle is dark and din@@ gy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and parti@@ tioned by plywood and a curtain .
__zh-cn__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__zh-cn__ St@@ anding in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__zh-cn__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__zh-cn__ There were no back doors .
__zh-cn__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__zh-cn__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__zh-cn__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic serv@@ itude , and the list can go on .
__zh-cn__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__zh-cn__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__zh-cn__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__zh-cn__ This is a family portrait .
__zh-cn__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__zh-cn__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submer@@ ge the silk into the liquid up to their el@@ bows , but the dye is toxic .
__zh-cn__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__zh-cn__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__zh-cn__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__zh-cn__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__zh-cn__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__zh-cn__ This young child is eight years old .
__zh-cn__ He was trem@@ bling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__zh-cn__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__zh-cn__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and wear@@ y , frightened children are thrown into the water to un@@ tether the lines .
__zh-cn__ Many of them drown .
__zh-cn__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__zh-cn__ Terri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__zh-cn__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__zh-cn__ in the cold , windy night .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__zh-cn__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__zh-cn__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__zh-cn__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabil@@ it@@ ates victims of slavery .
__zh-cn__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__zh-cn__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__zh-cn__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__zh-cn__ Dri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow aboli@@ tionist on a m@@ oped suddenly sped up to our cru@@ iser and tapped on the window .
__zh-cn__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__zh-cn__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__zh-cn__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible foot@@ path , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the v@@ ines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoist@@ ed the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__zh-cn__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people labor@@ ing .
__zh-cn__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were pan@@ ning for gold , w@@ ading in water poisoned by mercury .
__zh-cn__ Mer@@ cury is used in the extraction process .
__zh-cn__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__zh-cn__ When they came out of the shaft , they were so@@ aking wet from their own sweat .
__zh-cn__ I remember looking into their tired , blood@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__zh-cn__ The sha@@ fts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be p@@ ounded so that they can extract the gold .
__zh-cn__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__zh-cn__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__zh-cn__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , r@@ acked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__zh-cn__ This is Man@@ uru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__zh-cn__ When his uncle died , Man@@ uru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__zh-cn__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amp@@ ut@@ ated .
__zh-cn__ On top of that , Man@@ uru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__zh-cn__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__zh-cn__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__zh-cn__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I im@@ parted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__zh-cn__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__zh-cn__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__zh-cn__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__zh-cn__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deser@@ ving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__zh-cn__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistre@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__zh-cn__ I hope that these images awa@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the shadows .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .

__zh-cn__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__zh-cn__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__zh-cn__ R@@ ural to urban migration meant that new@@ found industrial materials started to replace hard-@@ to@@ -com@@ e-@@ by natural grasses .
__zh-cn__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__zh-cn__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__zh-cn__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside D@@ urban .
__zh-cn__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__zh-cn__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 wea@@ vers in about a year .
__zh-cn__ Soon we had out@@ grown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we co@@ er@@ ced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bo@@ b@@ bins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__zh-cn__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__zh-cn__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-@@ produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-@@ end dec@@ or market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__zh-cn__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Con@@ ran shops , and Don@@ na Kar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__zh-cn__ This is our group , our main group of wea@@ vers .
__zh-cn__ They come on a weekly basis to D@@ urban .
__zh-cn__ They all have bank accounts .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__zh-cn__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s also modern@@ ized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 wea@@ vers .
__zh-cn__ And the rest says it all .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .

__zh-cn__ In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s my clock .
__zh-cn__ It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
__zh-cn__ Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
__zh-cn__ So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
__zh-cn__ At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
__zh-cn__ Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
__zh-cn__ So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
__zh-cn__ However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
__zh-cn__ In each shot glass is a different sc@@ ented oil .
__zh-cn__ In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
__zh-cn__ This will warm up the sc@@ ented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
__zh-cn__ So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
__zh-cn__ Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
__zh-cn__ You can see why I hate Chris .
__zh-cn__ One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
__zh-cn__ This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gging me for well over a decade .
__zh-cn__ All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
__zh-cn__ Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
__zh-cn__ And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
__zh-cn__ So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
__zh-cn__ To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
__zh-cn__ Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
__zh-cn__ Any@@ time I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
__zh-cn__ Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
__zh-cn__ ( Mot@@ or@@ cy@@ le rev@@ ving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Tou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; Sm@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ aste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
__zh-cn__ So here are some other results .
__zh-cn__ The first is for instant nood@@ les .
__zh-cn__ Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
__zh-cn__ You know . ( S@@ lur@@ ps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
__zh-cn__ OK , next , clu@@ bbing .
__zh-cn__ These people I still do hang out with .
__zh-cn__ All right , and smoking .
__zh-cn__ Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
__zh-cn__ OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
__zh-cn__ It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
__zh-cn__ Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
__zh-cn__ In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
__zh-cn__ That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
__zh-cn__ Respon@@ dents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
__zh-cn__ So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
__zh-cn__ Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
__zh-cn__ And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
__zh-cn__ You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
__zh-cn__ In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
__zh-cn__ You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
__zh-cn__ Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
__zh-cn__ So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
__zh-cn__ We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfum@@ ator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
__zh-cn__ So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
__zh-cn__ Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a cl@@ ar@@ inet .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
__zh-cn__ Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the cl@@ ar@@ inet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
__zh-cn__ Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
__zh-cn__ Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-@@ factor .
__zh-cn__ Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
__zh-cn__ Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
__zh-cn__ Oh , one last thing before I leave .
__zh-cn__ And the best way to do that is with free candy .
__zh-cn__ You guys ready ?
__zh-cn__ All right .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
__zh-cn__ What could go wrong ?
__zh-cn__ and three left .
__zh-cn__ And the compliments stopped .
__zh-cn__ Well , at that moment , I was crying .
__zh-cn__ And the teacher was freaking out .
__zh-cn__ But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s one version .
__zh-cn__ I thought , wow , I know what I want to do now .
__zh-cn__ And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
__zh-cn__ You get the idea .
__zh-cn__ that was another version of me : one who will conquer the world .
__zh-cn__ Then , fast-forward another 14 years .
__zh-cn__ Nope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
__zh-cn__ Why is that ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
__zh-cn__ And every time that six-year-old won .
__zh-cn__ And this fear even persisted after I started my own company .
__zh-cn__ And that rejection hurt me .
__zh-cn__ Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
__zh-cn__ OK , I can build a better company .
__zh-cn__ I cannot let that six-year-old keep dict@@ ating my life anymore .
__zh-cn__ So this is where I went online and looked for help .
__zh-cn__ Then I found this website by luck .
__zh-cn__ And so here &apos;s what I did .
__zh-cn__ So this is where I went to where I was working .
__zh-cn__ So I just approached him .
__zh-cn__ I felt , wow , this is like a micro@@ cosm of my life .
__zh-cn__ This is where my life was turned upside down .
__zh-cn__ I went to a Kri@@ spy K@@ re@@ me .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
__zh-cn__ The doughnut maker took me so seriously .
__zh-cn__ I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
__zh-cn__ And then I learned a lot of things .
__zh-cn__ And because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t weird .
__zh-cn__ And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
__zh-cn__ And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quoted Martin Luther King , Jr .
__zh-cn__ And they embraced rejection .
__zh-cn__ I turned that into the biggest gift in my life .
__zh-cn__ I started teaching people how to turn re@@ jec@@ tions into opportunities .
__zh-cn__ ( Arabic ) I seek refu@@ ge in Allah from cur@@ sed Satan . In the Name of Allah , the most G@@ rac@@ ious , the most M@@ erci@@ ful .
__zh-cn__ ( English ) I was born in a middle class family .
__zh-cn__ My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a businessman .
__zh-cn__ But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
__zh-cn__ So I guess I was the lucky one .
__zh-cn__ My mother had 16 pregnancies .
__zh-cn__ From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
__zh-cn__ You can imagine as a child what I went through .
__zh-cn__ Day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
__zh-cn__ At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
__zh-cn__ So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dorm@@ itory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
__zh-cn__ So as a result , my father sent me to America .
__zh-cn__ I came to America .
__zh-cn__ I completed my education .
__zh-cn__ While I was completing my education , my country was invaded by Russia .
__zh-cn__ And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
__zh-cn__ There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
__zh-cn__ My family was in a refugee camp .
__zh-cn__ So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
__zh-cn__ I wanted them to be safe .
__zh-cn__ But where was my heart ?
__zh-cn__ My heart was in Afghanistan .
__zh-cn__ Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
__zh-cn__ I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
__zh-cn__ I had a good job .
__zh-cn__ I was a professor at a university .
__zh-cn__ I earned good money .
__zh-cn__ I had a good life .
__zh-cn__ My family was here .
__zh-cn__ I could live with them .
__zh-cn__ But I wasn &apos;t happy .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to go back home .
__zh-cn__ So I went to the refugee camp .
__zh-cn__ And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
__zh-cn__ About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
__zh-cn__ when I went day-to-day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
__zh-cn__ I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do .
__zh-cn__ I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
__zh-cn__ I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10@@ -to-@@ 12@@ -year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
__zh-cn__ So it was a very devastating situation .
__zh-cn__ My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
__zh-cn__ At that moment , we talk about momentum .
__zh-cn__ At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
__zh-cn__ How could I help these people ?
__zh-cn__ I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
__zh-cn__ But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
__zh-cn__ It transformed me . It gave me status .
__zh-cn__ It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
__zh-cn__ It helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
__zh-cn__ And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
__zh-cn__ But do you think it was easy ?
__zh-cn__ No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
__zh-cn__ And also , by Russia invading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
__zh-cn__ It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
__zh-cn__ Somebody who comes from the United States .
__zh-cn__ Somebody who got educated here .
__zh-cn__ Did they trust me ? Of course not .
__zh-cn__ So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
__zh-cn__ How am I going to do that ?
__zh-cn__ I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
__zh-cn__ I asked .
__zh-cn__ Finally , I found one man .
__zh-cn__ He was 80 years old .
__zh-cn__ He was a mul@@ lah .
__zh-cn__ I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
__zh-cn__ In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
__zh-cn__ one day I was in the office in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , Pakistan .
__zh-cn__ All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Run away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
__zh-cn__ You know your life is on the line .
__zh-cn__ But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
__zh-cn__ You have to hold it together and show strength .
__zh-cn__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
__zh-cn__ So I invited them to the office .
__zh-cn__ They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
__zh-cn__ They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Very mean@@ -looking people , black clothes , black tur@@ ban , and they pour into my office .
__zh-cn__ And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
__zh-cn__ They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
__zh-cn__ And of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but I was really shaking up .
__zh-cn__ But also I was strong , holding myself up .
__zh-cn__ And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
__zh-cn__ The only thing you could see , my eyes .
__zh-cn__ They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
__zh-cn__ Don &apos;t you know that school is banned for girls ?
__zh-cn__ What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
__zh-cn__ We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
__zh-cn__ And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking Pash@@ to .
__zh-cn__ They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offered them tea again , and they took a sip and they left .
__zh-cn__ By that time , my staff poured into my office .
__zh-cn__ They were scared to death .
__zh-cn__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
__zh-cn__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
__zh-cn__ But everybody was happy to see me .
__zh-cn__ Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
__zh-cn__ But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
__zh-cn__ We went underground and we provided education for 80 school@@ girls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
__zh-cn__ With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
__zh-cn__ We opened women &apos;s learning center .
__zh-cn__ We continuously opened clinics .
__zh-cn__ We worked with mothers and children .
__zh-cn__ We had reproductive health training .
__zh-cn__ We had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
__zh-cn__ I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
__zh-cn__ And one day , with four trainers and one body@@ guard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
__zh-cn__ Ri@@ fl@@ es on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
__zh-cn__ And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My body@@ guard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
__zh-cn__ What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
__zh-cn__ And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
__zh-cn__ I am very sha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it .
__zh-cn__ This time , we all are going to be killed .
__zh-cn__ There is no doubt in my mind .
__zh-cn__ But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s in your heart .
__zh-cn__ You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
__zh-cn__ So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
__zh-cn__ My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
__zh-cn__ And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
__zh-cn__ They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
__zh-cn__ We know where you are going .
__zh-cn__ Every day you go up north here and there .
__zh-cn__ You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
__zh-cn__ You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
__zh-cn__ What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
__zh-cn__ The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
__zh-cn__ So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I walked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the driver , &quot; &quot; Turn around and go back to the office . &quot; &quot; At that time , we only were supporting girls .
__zh-cn__ We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
__zh-cn__ By the time I came to the office , of course my trainers were gone .
__zh-cn__ They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
__zh-cn__ My body@@ guard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
__zh-cn__ I was sha@@ ken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
__zh-cn__ Because we had training going on up north already .
__zh-cn__ Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
__zh-cn__ So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
__zh-cn__ And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
__zh-cn__ She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
__zh-cn__ No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
__zh-cn__ &quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ I told her the whole story .
__zh-cn__ At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
__zh-cn__ You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car .
__zh-cn__ So we stopped the car .
__zh-cn__ I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
__zh-cn__ So I took them to the mosque , and to make a long story short , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
__zh-cn__ Today , they are the best trainers .
__zh-cn__ They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
__zh-cn__ Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
__zh-cn__ And they protect us .
__zh-cn__ And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ That tells you that education transforms people .
__zh-cn__ When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
__zh-cn__ We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
__zh-cn__ So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
__zh-cn__ I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
__zh-cn__ I just want to share this with you .
__zh-cn__ It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
__zh-cn__ We were going everywhere .
__zh-cn__ Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
__zh-cn__ We never locked our doors .
__zh-cn__ But you know what happened to my country .
__zh-cn__ Today , people cannot walk out of their door without security issues .
__zh-cn__ But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
__zh-cn__ And I want to tell you the other side .
__zh-cn__ Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
__zh-cn__ They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
__zh-cn__ They are training to be doctors , back again .
__zh-cn__ They are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
__zh-cn__ So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
__zh-cn__ I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
__zh-cn__ If you have these few things with you , you will accomplish .
__zh-cn__ We have one poet , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
__zh-cn__ He said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
__zh-cn__ And I tell you , we could .
__zh-cn__ And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very , very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__zh-cn__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__zh-cn__ Nairobi National Park is not f@@ enced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
__zh-cn__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__zh-cn__ They kill our livestock .
__zh-cn__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__zh-cn__ My community , the Maas@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__zh-cn__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__zh-cn__ The mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__zh-cn__ So they kill the lions .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__zh-cn__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__zh-cn__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__zh-cn__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__zh-cn__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__zh-cn__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cow@@ shed .
__zh-cn__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__zh-cn__ And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
__zh-cn__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cow@@ shed .
__zh-cn__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__zh-cn__ So one night , I was walking around the cow@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__zh-cn__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__zh-cn__ So I had an idea .
__zh-cn__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps mot@@ orists when they want to turn right or left . It blin@@ ks .
__zh-cn__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__zh-cn__ So I set up everything .
__zh-cn__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
__zh-cn__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__zh-cn__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__zh-cn__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cow@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__zh-cn__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__zh-cn__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__zh-cn__ One of them was this grandmother .
__zh-cn__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__zh-cn__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__zh-cn__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leop@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__zh-cn__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Broo@@ k@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__zh-cn__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__zh-cn__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__zh-cn__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__zh-cn__ And here I am today .
__zh-cn__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__zh-cn__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__zh-cn__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__zh-cn__ Ash@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__zh-cn__ So you got this scholar@@ ship@@ .@@ Richard Tur@@ ere : Yep .
__zh-cn__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__zh-cn__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric f@@ ence@@ .@@ CA : Electric fence ?
__zh-cn__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Tur@@ ere , you are something else .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .

__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a cray@@ on , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
__zh-cn__ At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
__zh-cn__ There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
__zh-cn__ When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
__zh-cn__ Ani@@ mation and art has always been my first love .
__zh-cn__ It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; &quot; Mal@@ icious Di@@ shes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
__zh-cn__ Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
__zh-cn__ And thus , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ icious Di@@ shes &quot; &quot; was born .
__zh-cn__ At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
__zh-cn__ That started my love for technology .
__zh-cn__ I built my first website myself in HT@@ ML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; &quot; The Poll@@ in@@ ators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
__zh-cn__ If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
__zh-cn__ So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) ( Foot stom@@ p ) ( Music ) ( Ro@@ ar ) Poll@@ in@@ ator : De@@ fore@@ st@@ sa@@ urus ! I should have known !
__zh-cn__ I need to call on the rest of the Poll@@ in@@ ators !
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
__zh-cn__ Ideas can spark a movement .
__zh-cn__ Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
__zh-cn__ Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
__zh-cn__ If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
__zh-cn__ At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
__zh-cn__ I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
__zh-cn__ I would find different fab@@ r@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
__zh-cn__ I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And I thought , I can start my own business .
__zh-cn__ Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
__zh-cn__ I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
__zh-cn__ My mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , I would sit and make little head@@ bands out of ribbon , and I would write down the names and the price of each item .
__zh-cn__ I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
__zh-cn__ Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
__zh-cn__ Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
__zh-cn__ Soon , my business really started to take off .
__zh-cn__ Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
__zh-cn__ Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
__zh-cn__ My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
__zh-cn__ I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after d@@ ye@@ ing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
__zh-cn__ For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
__zh-cn__ These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhal@@ es it .
__zh-cn__ So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
__zh-cn__ I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
__zh-cn__ We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
__zh-cn__ It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
__zh-cn__ That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
__zh-cn__ Thank you , and peace and blessings .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
__zh-cn__ Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethno@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__zh-cn__ Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sha@@ mans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himal@@ aya , the Budd@@ hi@@ sts still pursue the breath of the Dhar@@ ma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__zh-cn__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__zh-cn__ We go through initiation rites .
__zh-cn__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__zh-cn__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__zh-cn__ And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo ac@@ ol@@ ytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kais@@ ut desert of Northern Kenya , the Cur@@ and@@ ero in the mountains of the Andes , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ ai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slopes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__zh-cn__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the Earth .
__zh-cn__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__zh-cn__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__zh-cn__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspi@@ rations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__zh-cn__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisi@@ tive species .
__zh-cn__ And just as the biosphere has been severely ero@@ ded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__zh-cn__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__zh-cn__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__zh-cn__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__zh-cn__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__zh-cn__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__zh-cn__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__zh-cn__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__zh-cn__ What could be more lonely than to be envel@@ oped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__zh-cn__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllab@@ les of an ancient tongue .
__zh-cn__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__zh-cn__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__zh-cn__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__zh-cn__ Take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ onda who believe that mytho@@ logically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__zh-cn__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__zh-cn__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic ex@@ o@@ gamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__zh-cn__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__zh-cn__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__zh-cn__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Wa@@ orani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__zh-cn__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__zh-cn__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__zh-cn__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they spe@@ ared the five missionaries to death .
__zh-cn__ But the Wa@@ orani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__zh-cn__ They spe@@ ared each other .
__zh-cn__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
__zh-cn__ We traced genealo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pres@@ sured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ spic@@ acious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__zh-cn__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
__zh-cn__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ vali@@ er &apos;s strength and Ton@@ ton Mac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ uring the poison used to make zom@@ bies .
__zh-cn__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__zh-cn__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s interesting .
__zh-cn__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__zh-cn__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distil@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__zh-cn__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__zh-cn__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__zh-cn__ The spirits can be inv@@ oked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the god .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__zh-cn__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__zh-cn__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo ac@@ ol@@ ytes in a state of trance handling burning em@@ bers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cataly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
__zh-cn__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Colombia .
__zh-cn__ Des@@ c@@ endants of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once carpe@@ ted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__zh-cn__ In a blood@@ stained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__zh-cn__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__zh-cn__ The young ac@@ ol@@ ytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequest@@ ered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-@@ year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of ge@@ station they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__zh-cn__ And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__zh-cn__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affir@@ med in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__zh-cn__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__zh-cn__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__zh-cn__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alter@@ natively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__zh-cn__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mysti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far subt@@ ler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__zh-cn__ Now , what does that mean ?
__zh-cn__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__zh-cn__ Whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__zh-cn__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__zh-cn__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the K@@ wag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of Hux@@ wh@@ uk@@ w and the Cro@@ oked Be@@ ak of He@@ aven and the canni@@ bal spirits that dwell@@ ed at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Ham@@ at@@ sa initiation .
__zh-cn__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__zh-cn__ This is ay@@ ahu@@ asca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__zh-cn__ What makes ay@@ ahu@@ asca fascinating is not the sheer pharmac@@ ological potential of this preparation , but the elabor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mildly halluc@@ ino@@ genic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a sh@@ rub in the coffee family called Psy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ria vi@@ ri@@ dis .
__zh-cn__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryp@@ tamines , very close to brain serotonin , di@@ methyl@@ trypt@@ amine , 5-@@ meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ methyl@@ trypt@@ amine .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ anom@@ ami blowing that snu@@ ff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ methyl@@ trypt@@ amine .
__zh-cn__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with bar@@ oque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Sh@@ ul@@ tes — who is a man who sparked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryp@@ tamines as halluc@@ ino@@ genic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryp@@ tamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ ured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase .
__zh-cn__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the MAO .
__zh-cn__ Now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are MAO inhibit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the trypt@@ amine . So you ask yourself a question .
__zh-cn__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morpho@@ logically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__zh-cn__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__zh-cn__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__zh-cn__ This tribe , the C@@ of@@ an , has 17 varieties of ay@@ ahu@@ asca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
__zh-cn__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__zh-cn__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__zh-cn__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stam@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__zh-cn__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endor@@ sed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__zh-cn__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__zh-cn__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__zh-cn__ The Si@@ ou@@ x Indians did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bu@@ ggy .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__zh-cn__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identi@@ fiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gious deforestation in the homeland of the Pen@@ an — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sar@@ awa@@ k — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to serv@@ itude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__zh-cn__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Y@@ anom@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__zh-cn__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__zh-cn__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethno@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__zh-cn__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__zh-cn__ I once trav@@ elled 6,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ theastern Tibet to L@@ hasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to L@@ hasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the Cultural Revolution .
__zh-cn__ This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ chen Lama .
__zh-cn__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__zh-cn__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__zh-cn__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__zh-cn__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__zh-cn__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__zh-cn__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an arm@@ band of Mao , and for that transgres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__zh-cn__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ dem@@ ptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__zh-cn__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mono@@ chrom@@ atic world of monot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diversity ?
__zh-cn__ Margaret Me@@ ad , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amorph@@ ous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__zh-cn__ The Ne@@ olithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succum@@ bed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__zh-cn__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__zh-cn__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__zh-cn__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__zh-cn__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of B@@ aff@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , O@@ lay@@ uk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__zh-cn__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__zh-cn__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__zh-cn__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__zh-cn__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__zh-cn__ The runners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wrapped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hide .
__zh-cn__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the blizz@@ ard that was blowing .
__zh-cn__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and defec@@ ated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__zh-cn__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butch@@ ered a dog with it .
__zh-cn__ He skin@@ ned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es , shit knife in belt .
__zh-cn__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__zh-cn__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__zh-cn__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek re@@ stitution with its people .
__zh-cn__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
__zh-cn__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__zh-cn__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__zh-cn__ We think that po@@ lem@@ ics — ( Applause ) — we think that po@@ lem@@ ics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__zh-cn__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__zh-cn__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__zh-cn__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , plur@@ alistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__zh-cn__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__zh-cn__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and re@@ patri@@ ated .
__zh-cn__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__zh-cn__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__zh-cn__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__zh-cn__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__zh-cn__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__zh-cn__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__zh-cn__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
__zh-cn__ We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
__zh-cn__ If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
__zh-cn__ This is how the rooftop looks .
__zh-cn__ The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ rail . &quot;
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
__zh-cn__ So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a hand@@ rail . &quot;
__zh-cn__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__zh-cn__ There are three trees popping through .
__zh-cn__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a hand@@ rail .
__zh-cn__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__zh-cn__ They fall into the net .
__zh-cn__ And you get more , and more , more .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
__zh-cn__ It looks so nice from underneath .
__zh-cn__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__zh-cn__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__zh-cn__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__zh-cn__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__zh-cn__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__zh-cn__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__zh-cn__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__zh-cn__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__zh-cn__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__zh-cn__ Because there is no boundary .
__zh-cn__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__zh-cn__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
__zh-cn__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__zh-cn__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__zh-cn__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__zh-cn__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__zh-cn__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__zh-cn__ They need noise .
__zh-cn__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__zh-cn__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__zh-cn__ And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
__zh-cn__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__zh-cn__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -@@ 20 degrees in winter .
__zh-cn__ In summer you go swimming .
__zh-cn__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__zh-cn__ You never melt in rain .
__zh-cn__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__zh-cn__ So that is how we should treat them .
__zh-cn__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__zh-cn__ They are supposed to help teachers .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ A classroom .
__zh-cn__ And a wash@@ basin .
__zh-cn__ They talk to each other around the well .
__zh-cn__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__zh-cn__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ And each classroom has at least one sky@@ light .
__zh-cn__ And this is where Santa Cl@@ aus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__zh-cn__ This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -shaped kindergarten .
__zh-cn__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__zh-cn__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__zh-cn__ So you have to consider safety .
__zh-cn__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__zh-cn__ They tried to go in .
__zh-cn__ He hit his head .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__zh-cn__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__zh-cn__ And then we put other children .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__zh-cn__ Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
__zh-cn__ And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
__zh-cn__ This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__zh-cn__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__zh-cn__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__zh-cn__ Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__zh-cn__ They need to get some injury .
__zh-cn__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__zh-cn__ I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
__zh-cn__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
__zh-cn__ They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
__zh-cn__ So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
__zh-cn__ Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
__zh-cn__ U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
__zh-cn__ And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
__zh-cn__ And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
__zh-cn__ So , how big ?
__zh-cn__ Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
__zh-cn__ It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
__zh-cn__ And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
__zh-cn__ Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
__zh-cn__ But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
__zh-cn__ They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scal@@ ed@@ -down version of the entire universe .
__zh-cn__ And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
__zh-cn__ might be answered by studying these systems .
__zh-cn__ So that was very big .
__zh-cn__ The second things is very hot .
__zh-cn__ Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I sub@@ tract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
__zh-cn__ This is in false color .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
__zh-cn__ And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
__zh-cn__ The answer is hot gas , million-@@ degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
__zh-cn__ And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
__zh-cn__ The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
__zh-cn__ So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
__zh-cn__ There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
__zh-cn__ Third thing : probing the very small .
__zh-cn__ Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
__zh-cn__ Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
__zh-cn__ You were lied to .
__zh-cn__ Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
__zh-cn__ Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
__zh-cn__ And dark matter is no exception .
__zh-cn__ Well , how do we do this ?
__zh-cn__ To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
__zh-cn__ Here is an image .
__zh-cn__ Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scal@@ ed@@ -down versions .
__zh-cn__ They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this blu@@ ish purple .
__zh-cn__ The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
__zh-cn__ And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
__zh-cn__ So , it &apos;s very funny .
__zh-cn__ The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
__zh-cn__ Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
__zh-cn__ Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
__zh-cn__ Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
__zh-cn__ If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
__zh-cn__ What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-@@ increasing rate .
__zh-cn__ Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-@@ increasing rate .
__zh-cn__ They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
__zh-cn__ And , again , we want to learn more about it .
__zh-cn__ So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
__zh-cn__ Dep@@ ending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
__zh-cn__ Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
__zh-cn__ Here is a computer simulation .
__zh-cn__ And we need a way to simplify it .
__zh-cn__ Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
__zh-cn__ If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
__zh-cn__ The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
__zh-cn__ Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
__zh-cn__ So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
__zh-cn__ I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
__zh-cn__ Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
__zh-cn__ He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
__zh-cn__ And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
__zh-cn__ They are not faster horses .
__zh-cn__ They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
__zh-cn__ So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
__zh-cn__ And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Who am I ?
__zh-cn__ G@@ ain@@ fully employed .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a people person .
__zh-cn__ I keep fit .
__zh-cn__ Who am I looking for ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m looking for my idea mate .
__zh-cn__ Are you that idea that matches with who I really am ?
__zh-cn__ RW : Wow , we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date , huh ?
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re not making the face .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re making the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not good at life &quot; &quot; face .
__zh-cn__ RW : Do you want to get some pie ?
__zh-cn__ RW : So , are we going Dutch ?
__zh-cn__ 9@@ 71 ?
__zh-cn__ RW : One night , want to go to a movie or something ?
__zh-cn__ RW : I want to have your idea baby .
__zh-cn__ R@@ Wat@@ ts : Well , you know what they say in Russia .
__zh-cn__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__zh-cn__ At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , speci@@ alizing in cardiac imaging techniques .
__zh-cn__ The call came from a veterin@@ arian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__zh-cn__ An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial dro@@ op and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
__zh-cn__ They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
__zh-cn__ Now , to be clear , North American zoos are sta@@ ffed by highly qualified , board@@ -c@@ er@@ tified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
__zh-cn__ But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speci@@ ality consultation , and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help .
__zh-cn__ I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla didn &apos;t have a torn a@@ or@@ ta , evaluate this mac@@ a@@ w for a heart murm@@ ur , make sure that this California sea lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ dium wasn &apos;t infl@@ amed , and in this picture , I &apos;m listening to the heart of a lion after a lif@@ esaving , collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained 700 c@@ c &apos;s of fluid from the sac in which this lion &apos;s heart was contained .
__zh-cn__ And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
__zh-cn__ Now most of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
__zh-cn__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__zh-cn__ Phys@@ icians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : cong@@ estive heart failure , brain tumors , leukemia , diabetes , arthritis , ALS , breast cancer , even psychiatric syn@@ dr@@ omes like depression , anxiety , compul@@ sions , eating disorders and self-@@ injury .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
__zh-cn__ Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad — I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory — learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wake-up call for me .
__zh-cn__ So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterin@@ arian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
__zh-cn__ Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
__zh-cn__ For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
__zh-cn__ Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing cong@@ estive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
__zh-cn__ Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
__zh-cn__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__zh-cn__ Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gle@@ aming cathedrals of technology .
__zh-cn__ And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
__zh-cn__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__zh-cn__ Phys@@ icians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
__zh-cn__ But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
__zh-cn__ I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my Mac@@ Book .
__zh-cn__ I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
__zh-cn__ Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
__zh-cn__ When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
__zh-cn__ And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
__zh-cn__ Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
__zh-cn__ F@@ ear@@ -@@ induced heart failure .
__zh-cn__ Around the year 2000 , human cardi@@ ologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
__zh-cn__ It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the dice , in a bride who &apos;d been left at the alter .
__zh-cn__ But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
__zh-cn__ Veter@@ in@@ arians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos , from to deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
__zh-cn__ How many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. doc@@ s and cardi@@ ologists ?
__zh-cn__ Self-@@ injury .
__zh-cn__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__zh-cn__ Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
__zh-cn__ Some animal patients also harm themselves .
__zh-cn__ There are birds that pluck out feathers .
__zh-cn__ There are stal@@ lions that repeti@@ tively bite their fl@@ anks until they bleed .
__zh-cn__ But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-@@ injury in their self-@@ inj@@ uring animals .
__zh-cn__ Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ therapists and parents and patients struggling with self-@@ injury ?
__zh-cn__ Post@@ par@@ tum depression and post@@ par@@ tum psychosis .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
__zh-cn__ They may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
__zh-cn__ Equ@@ ine veterinarians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the fo@@ al , refusing to nurse , and in some instances , kick the fo@@ al , even to death .
__zh-cn__ But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this fo@@ al rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
__zh-cn__ Oxy@@ tocin is the bonding hormone , and this leads to renewed interest , on the part of the mare , in her fo@@ al .
__zh-cn__ Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of ob / g@@ yn &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with post@@ par@@ tum depression and psychosis ?
__zh-cn__ Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
__zh-cn__ To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
__zh-cn__ Some physicians can be real sno@@ bs about doctors who are not M.D. &apos; s .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m talking about dentists and opt@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
__zh-cn__ Of course , most physicians don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Homo sapiens , but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amphibians , reptiles , fish and birds .
__zh-cn__ So I don &apos;t blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession &apos;s con@@ descen@@ sion and ignorance .
__zh-cn__ But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterin@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
__zh-cn__ A physician . ( Laughter ) C@@ losing the gap has become a passion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on R@@ ounds at UCLA , where we &apos;re bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embed@@ ding them on our medical teams with our inter@@ ns and our residents .
__zh-cn__ And through Z@@ oobiquity conferences , where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabor@@ tive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
__zh-cn__ At Z@@ oobiquity conferences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher ; how understanding poly@@ cystic over@@ ies in a Hol@@ stein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-@@ str@@ ung Shel@@ tie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school .
__zh-cn__ In the United States and now internationally , at Z@@ oobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
__zh-cn__ After all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physicians to embrace our patients &apos; and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species-@@ spanning approach to health .
__zh-cn__ Because it turns out , some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
__zh-cn__ And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__zh-cn__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__zh-cn__ My train was a heart attack .
__zh-cn__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensi@@ ve@@ -c@@ are ward , recuper@@ ating from emergency surgery .
__zh-cn__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__zh-cn__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__zh-cn__ Gene@@ tics , lifestyle and environment .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__zh-cn__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__zh-cn__ And you know why I understand that ?
__zh-cn__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__zh-cn__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , leg@@ al-@@ size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your all@@ ergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__zh-cn__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__zh-cn__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__zh-cn__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__zh-cn__ We all have these .
__zh-cn__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__zh-cn__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__zh-cn__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__zh-cn__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__zh-cn__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__zh-cn__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__zh-cn__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__zh-cn__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trek@@ ker .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__zh-cn__ I started off in Scr@@ anton , Pennsylvania .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__zh-cn__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__zh-cn__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , sm@@ ol@@ dering coal waste look like .
__zh-cn__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-@@ west .
__zh-cn__ OK , so I ended up in Lou@@ is@@ ville , Kentucky .
__zh-cn__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rub@@ ber@@ town .
__zh-cn__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chlor@@ oprene and b@@ enz@@ ene .
__zh-cn__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-@@ age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__zh-cn__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__zh-cn__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__zh-cn__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__zh-cn__ And I moved to Red@@ lands California .
__zh-cn__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with partic@@ ulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__zh-cn__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__zh-cn__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__zh-cn__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__zh-cn__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__zh-cn__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__zh-cn__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__zh-cn__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__zh-cn__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__zh-cn__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__zh-cn__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__zh-cn__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__zh-cn__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__zh-cn__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__zh-cn__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__zh-cn__ Oh , not so lucky .
__zh-cn__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in at@@ l@@ ases all over the world .
__zh-cn__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__zh-cn__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__zh-cn__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__zh-cn__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__zh-cn__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__zh-cn__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__zh-cn__ Anybody got any clues ? Sk@@ i . Right .
__zh-cn__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__zh-cn__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monitored by the EPA .
__zh-cn__ Did you know that data existed ?
__zh-cn__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__zh-cn__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__zh-cn__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__zh-cn__ This might be what we end up with .
__zh-cn__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__zh-cn__ This could be my little assessment .
__zh-cn__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__zh-cn__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s called geome@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__zh-cn__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__zh-cn__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__zh-cn__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__zh-cn__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__zh-cn__ But it will also be useful for us .
__zh-cn__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__zh-cn__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__zh-cn__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__zh-cn__ Just look at that for a minute .
__zh-cn__ That was what the conclusion of the D@@ art@@ mouth Atlas of Health@@ care was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__zh-cn__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__zh-cn__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__zh-cn__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Ge@@ ography always matters .
__zh-cn__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So I was trained to become a gym@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 1970s .
__zh-cn__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__zh-cn__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__zh-cn__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
__zh-cn__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__zh-cn__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__zh-cn__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__zh-cn__ An opera singer must start training young to learn ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__zh-cn__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__zh-cn__ But no adults liked the idea .
__zh-cn__ No adults believed I was serious .
__zh-cn__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__zh-cn__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__zh-cn__ My dream would never come true .
__zh-cn__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second@@ -class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__zh-cn__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__zh-cn__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__zh-cn__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__zh-cn__ I turned to books .
__zh-cn__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ dence in the Family of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confuc@@ ian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane E@@ yre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Che@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Comple@@ te Works of San@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( aka E@@ cho Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons From History &quot; &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ jin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__zh-cn__ Books banned in China , of course .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__zh-cn__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__zh-cn__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confuc@@ ian guilt trap and to re@@ start my relationship with my parents .
__zh-cn__ En@@ countering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__zh-cn__ It offers many insights .
__zh-cn__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__zh-cn__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__zh-cn__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__zh-cn__ Compar@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__zh-cn__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__zh-cn__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__zh-cn__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__zh-cn__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__zh-cn__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McC@@ ull@@ ough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Kath@@ ar@@ ine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snow@@ ball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schro@@ eder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Ver@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chris@@ op@@ her Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Camp@@ bell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of My@@ th &quot; &quot; by Joseph Camp@@ bell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temp@@ tations .
__zh-cn__ For the Christ , the temp@@ tations are economic , political and spiritual .
__zh-cn__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__zh-cn__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Ch@@ u@@ ang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Ta@@ o : The Water@@ course Way &quot; &quot; Alan Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__zh-cn__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-@@ oh .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__zh-cn__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__zh-cn__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__zh-cn__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__zh-cn__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__zh-cn__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__zh-cn__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__zh-cn__ So may books be always with you .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__zh-cn__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__zh-cn__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vu@@ vu@@ z@@ ela , weird jokes about octop@@ i .
__zh-cn__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stres@@ sing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__zh-cn__ Being a mon@@ ol@@ ingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__zh-cn__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__zh-cn__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__zh-cn__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__zh-cn__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Car@@ ni@@ val parades .
__zh-cn__ Ethan Zucker@@ man : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__zh-cn__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for head@@ dresses , it evi@@ dently has certain halluc@@ ino@@ genic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__zh-cn__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snor@@ ting Galvao .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__zh-cn__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pit@@ ching in to help out .
__zh-cn__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__zh-cn__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a pr@@ ank , and actually a very , very good one .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__zh-cn__ In Portu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Buen@@ o , who &apos;s the lead soccer comment@@ ator for Re@@ de Glob@@ o .
__zh-cn__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__zh-cn__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just sp@@ outing cliche again and again and again .
__zh-cn__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this ban@@ ner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__zh-cn__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__zh-cn__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means re@@ tweeting a phrase .
__zh-cn__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__zh-cn__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__zh-cn__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__zh-cn__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__zh-cn__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__zh-cn__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__zh-cn__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__zh-cn__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__zh-cn__ Twitter recently did some research .
__zh-cn__ They looked at their local population .
__zh-cn__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__zh-cn__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__zh-cn__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Tr@@ ending T@@ op@@ ics .
__zh-cn__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__zh-cn__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Vie@@ gas and Martin W@@ atten@@ berg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__zh-cn__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that coo@@ kout is a mostly black conversation .
__zh-cn__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__zh-cn__ You click on that coo@@ kout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__zh-cn__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend El@@ i Par@@ iser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__zh-cn__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__zh-cn__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__zh-cn__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber@@ -@@ ut@@ op@@ ians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__zh-cn__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__zh-cn__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of E@@ vian water on the table .
__zh-cn__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__zh-cn__ This is the old economy .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is spe@@ edy , it &apos;s weight@@ less .
__zh-cn__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__zh-cn__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__zh-cn__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__zh-cn__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fi@@ j@@ ian feature film .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fi@@ j@@ ian music .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fi@@ j@@ ian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s crack@@ downs on the press .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__zh-cn__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__zh-cn__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__zh-cn__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__zh-cn__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__zh-cn__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__zh-cn__ Two hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the capit@@ ol of Fiji .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s all right there .
__zh-cn__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__zh-cn__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s extremely lum@@ py .
__zh-cn__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__zh-cn__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__zh-cn__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__zh-cn__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__zh-cn__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__zh-cn__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__zh-cn__ More of problems are global in scale .
__zh-cn__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__zh-cn__ And our media is less global by the day .
__zh-cn__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__zh-cn__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__zh-cn__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__zh-cn__ And she made a carto@@ gram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news ca@@ sts looked at for a month .
__zh-cn__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__zh-cn__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__zh-cn__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__zh-cn__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__zh-cn__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__zh-cn__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo@@ -co@@ ded .
__zh-cn__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__zh-cn__ Even within Wiki@@ pedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__zh-cn__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__zh-cn__ You probably won &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news read@@ ership is on domestic news sites .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__zh-cn__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmop@@ olit@@ anism .
__zh-cn__ We look at the internet .
__zh-cn__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__zh-cn__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__zh-cn__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red So@@ x scores .
__zh-cn__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__zh-cn__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__zh-cn__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__zh-cn__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__zh-cn__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__zh-cn__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__zh-cn__ We started in 2004 .
__zh-cn__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__zh-cn__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__zh-cn__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would re@@ wire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__zh-cn__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__zh-cn__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__zh-cn__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__zh-cn__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__zh-cn__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dre@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__zh-cn__ And so the people who founded Fo@@ ko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__zh-cn__ They were doing something much simpler .
__zh-cn__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__zh-cn__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__zh-cn__ Most independent media was shut down .
__zh-cn__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Fo@@ ko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__zh-cn__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__zh-cn__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Mal@@ agas@@ y .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__zh-cn__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__zh-cn__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__zh-cn__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__zh-cn__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this qu@@ eu@@ ed so a human being can translate this .
__zh-cn__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
__zh-cn__ And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__zh-cn__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__zh-cn__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__zh-cn__ They put it online for free .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Z@@ hang Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ hasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__zh-cn__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Ye@@ ey@@ an ?
__zh-cn__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__zh-cn__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__zh-cn__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__zh-cn__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__zh-cn__ We use a lot of search .
__zh-cn__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__zh-cn__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__zh-cn__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__zh-cn__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__zh-cn__ You end up f@@ locking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__zh-cn__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__zh-cn__ You need a guide .
__zh-cn__ So this is Amira Al Hus@@ sa@@ ini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__zh-cn__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__zh-cn__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__zh-cn__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of R@@ ama@@ dan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__zh-cn__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__zh-cn__ Basically , she &apos;s a de@@ ej@@ ay .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__zh-cn__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for de@@ ej@@ ays to reach a wider audience .
__zh-cn__ I know Amira .
__zh-cn__ I can ask her what to read .
__zh-cn__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__zh-cn__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web wi@@ dened .
__zh-cn__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really weird places .
__zh-cn__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is Afri@@ Gad@@ get .
__zh-cn__ And Afri@@ Gad@@ get is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__zh-cn__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a black@@ smith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Land@@ rover into a cold chi@@ sel .
__zh-cn__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I concei@@ vably care about this ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__zh-cn__ This is Erik Her@@ sman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__zh-cn__ He goes by the mon@@ i@@ ker White African .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__zh-cn__ He is a bridge figure .
__zh-cn__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__zh-cn__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this black@@ smith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__zh-cn__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__zh-cn__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__zh-cn__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xen@@ ophiles .
__zh-cn__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-@@ season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__zh-cn__ D@@ hani Jones , who is the middle line@@ back@@ er for the C@@ inc@@ innat@@ i Beng@@ als , has a slightly different approach to the off-@@ season .
__zh-cn__ D@@ hani has a television show .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ hani T@@ ack@@ les the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , D@@ hani travels to a different nation of the world .
__zh-cn__ He finds a local sporting team .
__zh-cn__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__zh-cn__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Mu@@ ay Thai boxing .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__zh-cn__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__zh-cn__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__zh-cn__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__zh-cn__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xen@@ op@@ hilia .
__zh-cn__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xen@@ ophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__zh-cn__ My challenge instead is this .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__zh-cn__ We have to figure out how to re@@ wire the systems that we have .
__zh-cn__ We have to fix our media .
__zh-cn__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__zh-cn__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__zh-cn__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__zh-cn__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xen@@ ophiles .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__zh-cn__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__zh-cn__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__zh-cn__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__zh-cn__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__zh-cn__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__zh-cn__ The question is , why ?
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s the un@@ romantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__zh-cn__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__zh-cn__ They have home-@@ bre@@ wed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__zh-cn__ One-@@ sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__zh-cn__ They are constantly up@@ grading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__zh-cn__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__zh-cn__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__zh-cn__ One-@@ sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have def@@ used the population bomb .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__zh-cn__ Stars have sh@@ ined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__zh-cn__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Tal@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__zh-cn__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__zh-cn__ Susan Boyle .
__zh-cn__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__zh-cn__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__zh-cn__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-@@ some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of N@@ es@@ sun Dor@@ ma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__zh-cn__ That was hilarious .
__zh-cn__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__zh-cn__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__zh-cn__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__zh-cn__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__zh-cn__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__zh-cn__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__zh-cn__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__zh-cn__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__zh-cn__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sher@@ aton — it &apos;s still there .
__zh-cn__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Y@@ ang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__zh-cn__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__zh-cn__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__zh-cn__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__zh-cn__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__zh-cn__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__zh-cn__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__zh-cn__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__zh-cn__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__zh-cn__ So I was on a national television pri@@ me-@@ time show .
__zh-cn__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__zh-cn__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my post@@ graduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my career .
__zh-cn__ So we do a lot of things .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__zh-cn__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__zh-cn__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__zh-cn__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__zh-cn__ I was representing the Shanghai Ex@@ p@@ o .
__zh-cn__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__zh-cn__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__zh-cn__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__zh-cn__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__zh-cn__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__zh-cn__ Well this is a girl called Gu@@ o M@@ ei@@ me@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful .
__zh-cn__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her micro@@ blog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__zh-cn__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Cham@@ ber of Commerce .
__zh-cn__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__zh-cn__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__zh-cn__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__zh-cn__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a sub@@ division of Red Cross at Cham@@ ber of Commerce .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__zh-cn__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__zh-cn__ It is still boiling .
__zh-cn__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-@@ backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__zh-cn__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
__zh-cn__ Micro@@ blog bo@@ omed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__zh-cn__ Sin@@ a@@ .com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million micro@@ bloggers .
__zh-cn__ On Ten@@ cent , 200 million .
__zh-cn__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9@@ .5 million followers , or fans .
__zh-cn__ About 80 percent of those micro@@ bloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__zh-cn__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__zh-cn__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__zh-cn__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__zh-cn__ So how are they different ?
__zh-cn__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-c@@ hild policy .
__zh-cn__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__zh-cn__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__zh-cn__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__zh-cn__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__zh-cn__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__zh-cn__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-@@ point@@ -@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__zh-cn__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__zh-cn__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__zh-cn__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__zh-cn__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__zh-cn__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__zh-cn__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__zh-cn__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__zh-cn__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__zh-cn__ They find themselves sort of sandwich@@ ed between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__zh-cn__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__zh-cn__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__zh-cn__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , ti@@ ghtening loans from banks , appreciation of the ren@@ min@@ bi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__zh-cn__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern O@@ EM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__zh-cn__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__zh-cn__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__zh-cn__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__zh-cn__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__zh-cn__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__zh-cn__ The first one is the Eng@@ els co@@ efficient , which explains that the cost of daily nec@@ es@@ sities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 3@@ 7-@@ some percent .
__zh-cn__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__zh-cn__ The G@@ ini co@@ efficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__zh-cn__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__zh-cn__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__zh-cn__ And also , the bitterness and even res@@ entment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__zh-cn__ So any accus@@ ations of corruption or back@@ door deal@@ ings between authorities or business would ar@@ ouse a social outcry or even un@@ rest .
__zh-cn__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__zh-cn__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__zh-cn__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__zh-cn__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__zh-cn__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__zh-cn__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requi@@ sition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__zh-cn__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__zh-cn__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__zh-cn__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__zh-cn__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__zh-cn__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slo@@ p .
__zh-cn__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__zh-cn__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__zh-cn__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__zh-cn__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__zh-cn__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__zh-cn__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__zh-cn__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__zh-cn__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__zh-cn__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__zh-cn__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their commitment to true love .
__zh-cn__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__zh-cn__ And the first picture showed us that a truck c@@ aging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__zh-cn__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__zh-cn__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__zh-cn__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__zh-cn__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__zh-cn__ After thousands of re@@ sends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__zh-cn__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__zh-cn__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__zh-cn__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__zh-cn__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__zh-cn__ And also , how capable is the system of self-c@@ or@@ rect@@ ness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__zh-cn__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__zh-cn__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ This back here was my brain cancer .
__zh-cn__ Isn &apos;t it nice ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phe@@ w .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Having brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shocking news for me .
__zh-cn__ I knew nothing about cancer .
__zh-cn__ In Western cultures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you disappear in a way .
__zh-cn__ Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
__zh-cn__ And everyone changes as well .
__zh-cn__ You suddenly become a disease on legs .
__zh-cn__ Doctors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
__zh-cn__ They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
__zh-cn__ People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
__zh-cn__ They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And in the meanwhile , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer .
__zh-cn__ These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
__zh-cn__ Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
__zh-cn__ And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
__zh-cn__ Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you .
__zh-cn__ But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who waits . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Things are changing , but class@@ ically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
__zh-cn__ But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
__zh-cn__ While I was in the hospital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it .
__zh-cn__ It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
__zh-cn__ I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s more to me .
__zh-cn__ A cure , whichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
__zh-cn__ I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ astic as a surgery .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
__zh-cn__ So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone .
__zh-cn__ So I created a website , which is called La Cura , on which I put my medical data , online .
__zh-cn__ I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cura — La Cura in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
__zh-cn__ In our Western cultures , it means eradicating or reversing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the Mediterranean , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
__zh-cn__ Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
__zh-cn__ I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
__zh-cn__ And , it worked .
__zh-cn__ The La Cura website went viral .
__zh-cn__ I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails , social networking — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
__zh-cn__ For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cura .
__zh-cn__ For example , here we see Franc@@ esca Fin@@ i in her performance .
__zh-cn__ Or , as artist Patrick Lich@@ ty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thin@@ gi@@ verse .
__zh-cn__ Now you can have my cancer , too !
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
__zh-cn__ And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
__zh-cn__ With all this information and support , I was able to form a team of several neurosur@@ geons , traditional doctors , onco@@ logists , and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving , which is very important .
__zh-cn__ And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
__zh-cn__ And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
__zh-cn__ &#91; Sur@@ gery &#93; The follow-up MRIs showed , luckily , little to no growth of the cancer .
__zh-cn__ So I was able to take my time and choose .
__zh-cn__ I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
__zh-cn__ Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of La Cura .
__zh-cn__ What are the outcomes ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-@@ grade gli@@ oma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
__zh-cn__ I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
__zh-cn__ Everything I did was thou@@ ghtfully designed to get me engaged .
__zh-cn__ Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
__zh-cn__ And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid .
__zh-cn__ Obviously , there were .
__zh-cn__ &#91; Open &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura .
__zh-cn__ Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
__zh-cn__ Doctors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually consult when they think about cancer .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a self-@@ founding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
__zh-cn__ &#91; Society &#93; The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components .
__zh-cn__ This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
__zh-cn__ And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cure for me , but for us all .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ A big challenge is , how should the iP@@ ads be used , and what apps should we put on the iP@@ ads ?
__zh-cn__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__zh-cn__ My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
__zh-cn__ I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from P@@ ab@@ lo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
__zh-cn__ Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
__zh-cn__ The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the tru@@ th@@ fulness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a kid , and I loved it , but I had no idea what it meant .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
__zh-cn__ So how could I un@@ tangle this k@@ not@@ ted bunch of sentences ?
__zh-cn__ And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Ven@@ n diagram .
__zh-cn__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . L@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve got truth and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the edge , in the middle .
__zh-cn__ That limin@@ al space , that &apos;s art .
__zh-cn__ All right . Ven@@ n diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
__zh-cn__ The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art , at least the art of fiction , was , was working with kids .
__zh-cn__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__zh-cn__ I would do it on my summers off from college , and I loved it .
__zh-cn__ It was a sports summer camp for four@@ - to six-year-olds .
__zh-cn__ I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I play sports at a four-year-old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ bble around some cones , and then got hot , and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life .
__zh-cn__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__zh-cn__ And soon , other kids who weren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Mac Bar@@ nett , right ?
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__zh-cn__ In my fantasy , they were s@@ vel@@ te Russian women , but , you know , four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley , California .
__zh-cn__ And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
__zh-cn__ I think the pinnacle of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Riley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
__zh-cn__ She would just take her fruit , her mom packed her a melon every day , and she would just throw it in the i@@ vy and then she would eat fruit sn@@ acks and pu@@ dding cups , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Riley , you can &apos;t do that , you have to eat the fruit . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you throw the fruit in the i@@ vy , pretty soon , it &apos;s going to be over@@ grown with mel@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutri@@ tionist for children .
__zh-cn__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of camp , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe from the grocery store and I hid it in the i@@ vy , and then at lunchtime , I was like , &quot; Riley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ dging through the i@@ vy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , why is there a sticker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the i@@ vy .
__zh-cn__ Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
__zh-cn__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__zh-cn__ She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith , for those moments where a story , no matter how strange , has some semblance of the truth , and then you &apos;re able to believe it .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__zh-cn__ Ad@@ ults can too , and we get there when we read .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s why in two days , people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloom@@ sday and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; Ul@@ ys@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though none of that happened .
__zh-cn__ Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sher@@ lock Holmes &apos; apartment , even though 2@@ 21@@ B is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address .
__zh-cn__ We know these characters aren &apos;t real , but we have real feelings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these characters aren &apos;t real ,
__zh-cn__ and yet we also know that they are .
__zh-cn__ Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
__zh-cn__ I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction .
__zh-cn__ When I was a kid , I was obsessed with secret door novels , things like &quot; &quot; Nar@@ nia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a magical land .
__zh-cn__ And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s closet doors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s closet , and there was not a secret magical land there .
__zh-cn__ There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
__zh-cn__ After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret doors .
__zh-cn__ This is a place called 826 Valencia .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s at 826 Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco , and when I worked there , there was a publishing company head@@ quar@@ tered there called Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s , a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia , but then the front of it was a strange shop .
__zh-cn__ You see , this place was zoned retail , and in San Francisco , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writer who founded it , a writer named Dave E@@ ggers , to come into compliance with code , he said , &quot; &quot; Fine , I &apos;m just going to build a pirate supply store . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wood .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s drawers you can pull out and get cit@@ rus so you don &apos;t get sc@@ ur@@ vy .
__zh-cn__ They have eye@@ patches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s spring@@ time , pirates want to go wild .
__zh-cn__ You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pa@@ ste@@ l .
__zh-cn__ Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
__zh-cn__ And the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , limin@@ al , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
__zh-cn__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__zh-cn__ So we have The E@@ cho Park Time Tra@@ vel Mart .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on Sun@@ set Boulevard in Los Angeles .
__zh-cn__ Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s our Employe@@ es of the Mon@@ th , including Gen@@ gh@@ is Khan , Charles Dickens .
__zh-cn__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__zh-cn__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__zh-cn__ We have some patent medicines , Can@@ op@@ ic jars for your organs , communist soap that says , &quot; &quot; This is your soap for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Our sl@@ ushy machine broke on the opening night and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
__zh-cn__ Our architect was covered in red syr@@ up .
__zh-cn__ It looked like he had just murdered somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular architect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
__zh-cn__ It was going to be the highlight of our store .
__zh-cn__ So we just put that sign on it that said , &quot; &quot; Out of order . Come back yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that ended up being a better joke than sl@@ us@@ hies , so we just left it there forever .
__zh-cn__ Mam@@ moth Ch@@ unks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__zh-cn__ Bar@@ b@@ arian rep@@ ell@@ ent . It &apos;s full of salad and pot@@ p@@ our@@ ri — things that barb@@ arians hate .
__zh-cn__ Dead languages .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Le@@ eches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__zh-cn__ And Viking O@@ dor@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : toen@@ ails , sweat and rotten vegetables , py@@ re ash .
__zh-cn__ Because we believe that Ax@@ e Body Spr@@ ay is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
__zh-cn__ Our biggest seller is Scha@@ den@@ fre@@ ude , which we did not expect .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s a nonprofit behind it , and kids go through a door that says &quot; &quot; Employe@@ es Only &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a quarterly that &apos;s published with just writing that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
__zh-cn__ The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t find the seams on the fiction , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fiction that &apos;s colonized the real world .
__zh-cn__ I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a term called meta@@ fiction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and met@@ a &apos;s having a moment now .
__zh-cn__ Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like John Bar@@ th and William Gad@@ dis , but it &apos;s been around .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
__zh-cn__ And one meta@@ fic@@ tive technique is breaking the fourth wall . Right ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s when an actor will turn to the audience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an actor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that supposedly honest moment , I would argue , is in service of the lie , but it &apos;s supposed to foreground the artifici@@ ality of the fiction .
__zh-cn__ For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
__zh-cn__ If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
__zh-cn__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__zh-cn__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__zh-cn__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Billy Twit@@ ters and his Blue Whale Pro@@ ble@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it &apos;s a punishment and it ruins his life .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by Fed@@ Up .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
__zh-cn__ He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue whale in .
__zh-cn__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__zh-cn__ This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
__zh-cn__ But underneath the jacket is this case , and that &apos;s the cover underneath the book , the jacket , and there &apos;s an ad that offers a free 30-@@ day risk-@@ free trial for a blue whale .
__zh-cn__ And you can just send in a self-@@ addressed stamped envelope and we &apos;ll send you a whale .
__zh-cn__ And kids do write in .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
__zh-cn__ Eliot G@@ annon ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm — ( Laughter ) — that says that due to a change in customs laws , their whale has been held up in So@@ g@@ ne@@ fjord , which is a very lovely fjord , and then it just kind of talks about So@@ g@@ ne@@ fjord and Norwegian food for a little while . It di@@ gres@@ ses . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
__zh-cn__ And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the out@@ going message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
__zh-cn__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__zh-cn__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__zh-cn__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__zh-cn__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__zh-cn__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__zh-cn__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__zh-cn__ Mac Bar@@ nett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__zh-cn__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__zh-cn__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__zh-cn__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__zh-cn__ You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the crossword puzzles that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from Nico .
__zh-cn__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__zh-cn__ &#91; Be@@ ep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
__zh-cn__ So have a nice Christmas , and b@@ ye@@ -@@ bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
__zh-cn__ MB : I actually got Nico , I hadn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
__zh-cn__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysit@@ ter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__zh-cn__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__zh-cn__ I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
__zh-cn__ I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ hew , phe@@ w , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( V@@ v@@ v@@ wow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
__zh-cn__ See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Por@@ tam@@ en@@ to ) — and you can get it really low .
__zh-cn__ And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
__zh-cn__ ( T@@ ones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
__zh-cn__ ( F@@ lou@@ rish ... Be@@ ep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I star@@ tle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( B@@ lip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re going to do a song by David M@@ ash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
__zh-cn__ And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ emin .
__zh-cn__ It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Lé@@ on Ther@@ emin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ emin , I think , when he was working on some shor@@ tw@@ ave radios .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Scre@@ eching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the ther@@ emin the way it is now .
__zh-cn__ And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a ther@@ emin by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ oo-@@ hoo@@ -@@ hoo@@ -@@ hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci@@ -fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo@@ -@@ hoo@@ -@@ hoo@@ -@@ hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
__zh-cn__ And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibra@@ to gets out of hand .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
__zh-cn__ You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
__zh-cn__ It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
__zh-cn__ And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( T@@ one rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
__zh-cn__ And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Te@@ e@@ tering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
__zh-cn__ it &apos;s similar to being a voc@@ alist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
__zh-cn__ You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bum@@ mer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
__zh-cn__ I think we will play another tune now .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; L@@ ush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abo@@ lished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his &quot; &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; &quot; speech .
__zh-cn__ I was born in a family full of colors .
__zh-cn__ My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
__zh-cn__ He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
__zh-cn__ The matriarch , my grandma , has a por@@ cel@@ ain skin and cotton@@ -like hair .
__zh-cn__ My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
__zh-cn__ My mother is a cin@@ nam@@ on-@@ skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of haz@@ el and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
__zh-cn__ She has two sisters .
__zh-cn__ One in a to@@ a@@ ste@@ d-@@ peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the be@@ i@@ ge side , like a p@@ anc@@ ake .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
__zh-cn__ Outside home , however , things were different soon .
__zh-cn__ Color had many other meanings .
__zh-cn__ I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
__zh-cn__ It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique fl@@ esh@@ -colored pencil .
__zh-cn__ I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
__zh-cn__ My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
__zh-cn__ I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
__zh-cn__ Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
__zh-cn__ By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
__zh-cn__ I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
__zh-cn__ And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
__zh-cn__ Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot belong to some places .
__zh-cn__ In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
__zh-cn__ However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
__zh-cn__ Years later I married a Spani@@ ard .
__zh-cn__ But not any Spani@@ ard .
__zh-cn__ I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sun@@ burnt .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
__zh-cn__ What will be the color of your children ?
__zh-cn__ As you can understand , this is my last concern .
__zh-cn__ But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
__zh-cn__ And that is how Humanae was born .
__zh-cn__ Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the un@@ true white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
__zh-cn__ I portray the subjects in a white background .
__zh-cn__ Then I choose an 1@@ 1-@@ pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pant@@ one .
__zh-cn__ I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
__zh-cn__ The snowball started to roll .
__zh-cn__ The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
__zh-cn__ just happened .
__zh-cn__ And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fos@@ ters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
__zh-cn__ I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
__zh-cn__ Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
__zh-cn__ In Paris , from the UNESCO He@@ ad@@ quarters to a shelter .
__zh-cn__ And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
__zh-cn__ All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or termin@@ ally ill .
__zh-cn__ We all together build Humanae .
__zh-cn__ Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
__zh-cn__ When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
__zh-cn__ Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
__zh-cn__ Or does it have to do with our origin , nationality or bank account ?
__zh-cn__ This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
__zh-cn__ Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
__zh-cn__ It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
__zh-cn__ It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
__zh-cn__ I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
__zh-cn__ A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me , &quot; &quot; Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence , as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway .
__zh-cn__ So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
__zh-cn__ Perhaps we should stop .
__zh-cn__ Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m M@@ assi@@ el .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a Domin@@ ican-@@ Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
__zh-cn__ Just to show you some examples , illustr@@ ators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a collection of faces .
__zh-cn__ One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
__zh-cn__ And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
__zh-cn__ teachers .
__zh-cn__ They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
__zh-cn__ Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
__zh-cn__ My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-@@ portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
__zh-cn__ As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
__zh-cn__ As an individual , as An@@ g@@ é@@ lica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
__zh-cn__ becomes love .
__zh-cn__ The last country — the last country in the world who abo@@ lished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
__zh-cn__ We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
__zh-cn__ That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__zh-cn__ I feel so fortunate .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__zh-cn__ I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
__zh-cn__ It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
__zh-cn__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__zh-cn__ Her name is P@@ am Mor@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le County , Virginia , the foo@@ th@@ ills of the Blue R@@ idge Mountains .
__zh-cn__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__zh-cn__ She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Twee@@ ts , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__zh-cn__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather@@ -@@ worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of ric@@ ke@@ ty .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__zh-cn__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in South@@ western Virginia , in the coal mines and the farm@@ lands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from p@@ lowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__zh-cn__ And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
__zh-cn__ And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
__zh-cn__ It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__zh-cn__ It all started back in 1977 .
__zh-cn__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__zh-cn__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing inter@@ mit@@ tent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a mystical quest .
__zh-cn__ And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing ro@@ bes and my big beard and my John Len@@ non glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they p@@ lead@@ ed with me to get a degree in something .
__zh-cn__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__zh-cn__ It was an experimental education program .
__zh-cn__ It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
__zh-cn__ And I went in for a job interview in the Rich@@ mond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-@@ piece suit — my con@@ cession to convention — kept my long beard and my afr@@ o and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__zh-cn__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the super@@ visor , her name was Anna Ar@@ o , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__zh-cn__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gi@@ fted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__zh-cn__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__zh-cn__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__zh-cn__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__zh-cn__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__zh-cn__ And she cleared such a space that I endeav@@ ored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__zh-cn__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__zh-cn__ His name is Chris Far@@ ina .
__zh-cn__ Chris Far@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
__zh-cn__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Gra@@ de A@@ chiev@@ ements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__zh-cn__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__zh-cn__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__zh-cn__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__zh-cn__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__zh-cn__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__zh-cn__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wry smile under his hand@@ le@@ bar mustache .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__zh-cn__ I saw Jan Pol@@ o &apos;s flashing eyes .
__zh-cn__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__zh-cn__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__zh-cn__ And I saw Miss E@@ the@@ l J. Banks who wore pearls and high-@@ heels to elementary school every day .
__zh-cn__ And you know , she had that old-@@ school teacher stare .
__zh-cn__ You know the one .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__zh-cn__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__zh-cn__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__zh-cn__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__zh-cn__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__zh-cn__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__zh-cn__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__zh-cn__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Mad@@ eline .
__zh-cn__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__zh-cn__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__zh-cn__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__zh-cn__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__zh-cn__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-@@ foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__zh-cn__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__zh-cn__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__zh-cn__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__zh-cn__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Ple@@ xig@@ lass structure .
__zh-cn__ And it has four Ple@@ xig@@ lass layers .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__zh-cn__ There are four countries around the board .
__zh-cn__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__zh-cn__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__zh-cn__ And each country has a cabinet .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CF@@ O , or Comp@@ trol@@ ler .
__zh-cn__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__zh-cn__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__zh-cn__ And then there &apos;s a 13@@ -@@ page crisis document with 50 inter@@ locking problems .
__zh-cn__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__zh-cn__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__zh-cn__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , break@@ away re@@ public@@ s , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__zh-cn__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my four@@ th-graders from Ag@@ nor@@ -@@ Hur@@ t and V@@ enable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ So I also have in the game a sabot@@ eur — some child — it &apos;s basically a trouble@@ maker — and I have my trouble@@ maker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__zh-cn__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__zh-cn__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambigu@@ ities and ir@@ relev@@ ancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__zh-cn__ The sabot@@ eur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Four@@ th-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__zh-cn__ They learn to overlook short-@@ sighted reactions and impul@@ sive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__zh-cn__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a Co@@ Evolution Qu@@ ar@@ terly article on a peace force .
__zh-cn__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m just a clock wat@@ cher .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m just a clari@@ fier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__zh-cn__ The students run the game .
__zh-cn__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__zh-cn__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__zh-cn__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__zh-cn__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__zh-cn__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__zh-cn__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__zh-cn__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__zh-cn__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__zh-cn__ ( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__zh-cn__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__zh-cn__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__zh-cn__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-@@ rich neighbor .
__zh-cn__ Without provoc@@ ation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-@@ door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__zh-cn__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__zh-cn__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__zh-cn__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__zh-cn__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
__zh-cn__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
__zh-cn__ And we were very upset .
__zh-cn__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__zh-cn__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__zh-cn__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__zh-cn__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__zh-cn__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__zh-cn__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__zh-cn__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__zh-cn__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__zh-cn__ We have a letter in the game .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__zh-cn__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your con@@ dol@@ ences .
__zh-cn__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__zh-cn__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Ag@@ nor@@ -@@ Hur@@ t School in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;ll be more real@@ er if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she ga@@ mely picked up the letter .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__zh-cn__ She read two sentences .
__zh-cn__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__zh-cn__ I was in tears .
__zh-cn__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not glo@@ ating .
__zh-cn__ We all lose .
__zh-cn__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__zh-cn__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__zh-cn__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__zh-cn__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__zh-cn__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__zh-cn__ JH : I get ch@@ ills every time I see that .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__zh-cn__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__zh-cn__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__zh-cn__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__zh-cn__ This is about my friend Bren@@ nan .
__zh-cn__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the inter@@ locking crises .
__zh-cn__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__zh-cn__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__zh-cn__ The World Bank president was a third-@@ gra@@ der one time .
__zh-cn__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__zh-cn__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__zh-cn__ There was no way they could win .
__zh-cn__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut@@ -off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__zh-cn__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__zh-cn__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__zh-cn__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__zh-cn__ And I was just feeling so sad and de@@ jected .
__zh-cn__ And suddenly , Bren@@ nan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a re@@ conven@@ ing of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__zh-cn__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dos@@ si@@ ers .
__zh-cn__ They get these dos@@ si@@ ers full of secret documents .
__zh-cn__ They were ges@@ tic@@ ulating ; they were running around .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__zh-cn__ Princi@@ pal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__zh-cn__ The parents were looking in the window .
__zh-cn__ And Bren@@ nan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__zh-cn__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pool@@ ed all our funds together .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__zh-cn__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__zh-cn__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__zh-cn__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__zh-cn__ Sp@@ on@@ taneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__zh-cn__ Every game we play is different .
__zh-cn__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__zh-cn__ Some games are more about warfare .
__zh-cn__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__zh-cn__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a blood@@ less way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__zh-cn__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__zh-cn__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__zh-cn__ If only .
__zh-cn__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__zh-cn__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__zh-cn__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__zh-cn__ D@@ rought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__zh-cn__ With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
__zh-cn__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__zh-cn__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__zh-cn__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__zh-cn__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__zh-cn__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__zh-cn__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__zh-cn__ He eventually gets married .
__zh-cn__ He starts this new life .
__zh-cn__ He has a purpose in life .
__zh-cn__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an az@@ ure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__zh-cn__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__zh-cn__ So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
__zh-cn__ He was waiting .
__zh-cn__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__zh-cn__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__zh-cn__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__zh-cn__ It is the story of the disen@@ franchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__zh-cn__ For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
__zh-cn__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__zh-cn__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__zh-cn__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__zh-cn__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__zh-cn__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__zh-cn__ They pretty much do nothing .
__zh-cn__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__zh-cn__ I remember standing in front of that bul@@ le@@ t-@@ ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__zh-cn__ What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
__zh-cn__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__zh-cn__ My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
__zh-cn__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__zh-cn__ We sat down and brainstor@@ med on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__zh-cn__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__zh-cn__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__zh-cn__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__zh-cn__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__zh-cn__ They sought people like him out .
__zh-cn__ But his story takes a different route .
__zh-cn__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__zh-cn__ Twenty-@@ three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around .
__zh-cn__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__zh-cn__ He started a motorbike company .
__zh-cn__ He began renting out motor@@ bikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__zh-cn__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__zh-cn__ How is this story different ?
__zh-cn__ What makes his story different ?
__zh-cn__ I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__zh-cn__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__zh-cn__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__zh-cn__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Moham@@ oud , a fl@@ orist .
__zh-cn__ He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ orist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bou@@ qu@@ ets shipped from abroad .
__zh-cn__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__zh-cn__ He started a landsc@@ aping and design floral company .
__zh-cn__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tu@@ lips and li@@ lies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__zh-cn__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__zh-cn__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__zh-cn__ And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
__zh-cn__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__zh-cn__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__zh-cn__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__zh-cn__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__zh-cn__ By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
__zh-cn__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__zh-cn__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__zh-cn__ They need expertise and ment@@ or@@ ship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__zh-cn__ Con@@ nect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation , and you will create cataly@@ sts for urban growth .
__zh-cn__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__zh-cn__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__zh-cn__ I believe he is selling hope .
__zh-cn__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__zh-cn__ Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
__zh-cn__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__zh-cn__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__zh-cn__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incub@@ ate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__zh-cn__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__zh-cn__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jam@@ ire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burn@@ is@@ s Tra@@ vis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian S@@ ands on the piano . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So the band@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__zh-cn__ It is really a sacred space .
__zh-cn__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__zh-cn__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__zh-cn__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the band@@ stand .
__zh-cn__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__zh-cn__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; T@@ iti Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__zh-cn__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__zh-cn__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__zh-cn__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__zh-cn__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the band@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__zh-cn__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__zh-cn__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__zh-cn__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__zh-cn__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__zh-cn__ If you played an E.
__zh-cn__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__zh-cn__ If you played an F # though , ( Dis@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__zh-cn__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__zh-cn__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__zh-cn__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__zh-cn__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__zh-cn__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__zh-cn__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__zh-cn__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__zh-cn__ So there is no mistake .
__zh-cn__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__zh-cn__ So jazz , this band@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a very puri@@ fying experience .
__zh-cn__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__zh-cn__ We know that to be able to come on the band@@ stand and play music is a blessing .
__zh-cn__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__zh-cn__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__zh-cn__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ roman@@ age in jazz .
__zh-cn__ You have some people who do .
__zh-cn__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__zh-cn__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__zh-cn__ ready , just play some time .
__zh-cn__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__zh-cn__ This is a science of listening .
__zh-cn__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__zh-cn__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__zh-cn__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__zh-cn__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__zh-cn__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthr@@ alled to in education .
__zh-cn__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__zh-cn__ I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
__zh-cn__ So most everyone watches TV .
__zh-cn__ We like it . We like some parts of it .
__zh-cn__ Here in America , people actually love TV .
__zh-cn__ The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
__zh-cn__ Okay ?
__zh-cn__ Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
__zh-cn__ But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
__zh-cn__ They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
__zh-cn__ They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
__zh-cn__ My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
__zh-cn__ So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
__zh-cn__ So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
__zh-cn__ Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re talking about top-10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rated shows over the course of 50 years .
__zh-cn__ How do these Ni@@ el@@ sen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
__zh-cn__ How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
__zh-cn__ Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
__zh-cn__ You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acqui@@ si@@ tiveness .
__zh-cn__ As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
__zh-cn__ We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
__zh-cn__ We feel awe , we feel pity .
__zh-cn__ That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
__zh-cn__ The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
__zh-cn__ We love to watch TV .
__zh-cn__ This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
__zh-cn__ Anim@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
__zh-cn__ So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
__zh-cn__ Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
__zh-cn__ I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
__zh-cn__ Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
__zh-cn__ So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
__zh-cn__ We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
__zh-cn__ We surveyed the top-@@ 20 Ni@@ el@@ sen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
__zh-cn__ We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,@@ 600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
__zh-cn__ How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
__zh-cn__ Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
__zh-cn__ Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
__zh-cn__ What did this mean for you ?
__zh-cn__ So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
__zh-cn__ But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
__zh-cn__ And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
__zh-cn__ So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
__zh-cn__ Two acknowled@@ gments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
__zh-cn__ And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
__zh-cn__ Okay , here we go .
__zh-cn__ So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
__zh-cn__ Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
__zh-cn__ Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
__zh-cn__ As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
__zh-cn__ Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
__zh-cn__ Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wan@@ e .
__zh-cn__ Why ?
__zh-cn__ The Cuban Mis@@ sile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , ML@@ K is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Water@@ gate .
__zh-cn__ Look what happens .
__zh-cn__ In 1970 , inspiration plumme@@ ts .
__zh-cn__ Moral ambiguity takes off .
__zh-cn__ They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a tele@@ genic president , is in office .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s trying to recover .
__zh-cn__ But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-@@ Con@@ tra , the Chall@@ enger disaster , Chernobyl .
__zh-cn__ Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
__zh-cn__ Take a look at this .
__zh-cn__ This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
__zh-cn__ But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irrever@@ ence in blue and green .
__zh-cn__ Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bon@@ anza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gun@@ smoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Gri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
__zh-cn__ This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
__zh-cn__ Ir@@ reverence starts to rise .
__zh-cn__ Social commentary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
__zh-cn__ You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
__zh-cn__ You have comfort , irrever@@ ence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gun@@ smoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ omer P@@ yle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-@@ two- and number-@@ three-@@ rated television shows .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s number one ?
__zh-cn__ The socially irrever@@ ent hippie show , &quot; R@@ owan and Martin &apos;s Laugh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re all living together , right .
__zh-cn__ Vie@@ wers had responded dramatically .
__zh-cn__ Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bell@@ wether show .
__zh-cn__ When you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
__zh-cn__ It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
__zh-cn__ This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a break@@ out show .
__zh-cn__ So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
__zh-cn__ In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
__zh-cn__ Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
__zh-cn__ Social commentary and irrever@@ ence rise throughout the 70s .
__zh-cn__ Now look at this .
__zh-cn__ The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
__zh-cn__ You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
__zh-cn__ In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irrever@@ ence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
__zh-cn__ Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
__zh-cn__ It can make me feel this ?
__zh-cn__ It can change us ?
__zh-cn__ So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
__zh-cn__ Archie Bun@@ ker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
__zh-cn__ This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
__zh-cn__ Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
__zh-cn__ No . In the 70s you have the bell@@ wether show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ onic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocke@@ ted into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Milli@@ on-@@ D@@ oll@@ ar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s An@@ gels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
__zh-cn__ What were those shows ?
__zh-cn__ Glam@@ orous and rich .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fant@@ asy Island . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
__zh-cn__ So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
__zh-cn__ Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three@@ -c@@ am@@ era sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
__zh-cn__ Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
__zh-cn__ The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ as@@ ier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ in@@ feld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
__zh-cn__ But look : X marks the spot .
__zh-cn__ In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succum@@ bs to judgment once and for all .
__zh-cn__ Why not ?
__zh-cn__ We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
__zh-cn__ We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
__zh-cn__ We had 9 / 11 .
__zh-cn__ Anth@@ rax becomes part of the social lexicon .
__zh-cn__ Look what happens when we keep going .
__zh-cn__ At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
__zh-cn__ What do people want in their TV then ?
__zh-cn__ I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
__zh-cn__ Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
__zh-cn__ No , they want judgment .
__zh-cn__ I can vote you off the island .
__zh-cn__ I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
__zh-cn__ I can choose the next American I@@ dol . You &apos;re fired .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s all great , right ?
__zh-cn__ So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
__zh-cn__ There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
__zh-cn__ The 1950s : June Cle@@ ever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Be@@ aver . &quot; &quot; Luc@@ ille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
__zh-cn__ Mau@@ de Fin@@ d@@ lay , the epit@@ ome of the irrever@@ ent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even men@@ op@@ ause on TV .
__zh-cn__ The 1980s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carr@@ ington .
__zh-cn__ Mur@@ phy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single par@@ enthood .
__zh-cn__ This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree Van de Kam@@ p .
__zh-cn__ Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
__zh-cn__ So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
__zh-cn__ But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
__zh-cn__ They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
__zh-cn__ So thanks very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Van@@ ne@@ var Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__zh-cn__ This is Van@@ ne@@ var Bush .
__zh-cn__ Van@@ ne@@ var Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__zh-cn__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Mon@@ thly .
__zh-cn__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Van@@ ne@@ var Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__zh-cn__ The brain works by association .
__zh-cn__ With one item in its thought , it sn@@ aps instantly to the next item .
__zh-cn__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__zh-cn__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x .
__zh-cn__ And the me@@ me@@ x would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__zh-cn__ Now this was in 1945 .
__zh-cn__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__zh-cn__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__zh-cn__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__zh-cn__ And he proposed this machine called the me@@ me@@ x .
__zh-cn__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__zh-cn__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__zh-cn__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__zh-cn__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__zh-cn__ And by the mid-@@ 60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__zh-cn__ He built a system .
__zh-cn__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__zh-cn__ And in a pre@@ mon@@ ition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and sof@@ tw@@ ares of service , his system was called N@@ LS for o@@ N-@@ Line System .
__zh-cn__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__zh-cn__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Jo@@ int Computer Conference in 1968 .
__zh-cn__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__zh-cn__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__zh-cn__ And he works this system .
__zh-cn__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__zh-cn__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-@@ finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__zh-cn__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__zh-cn__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__zh-cn__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__zh-cn__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__zh-cn__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__zh-cn__ And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__zh-cn__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__zh-cn__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__zh-cn__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__zh-cn__ They had a 12-@@ page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__zh-cn__ The magazines started to cover it .
__zh-cn__ B@@ y@@ te magazine and Commun@@ ications at the AC@@ M had special issues covering hypertext .
__zh-cn__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__zh-cn__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__zh-cn__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__zh-cn__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__zh-cn__ We developed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on ht@@ m@@ l .
__zh-cn__ We called it hm@@ l : hypertext mark@@ up language .
__zh-cn__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__zh-cn__ So I took this system to a trade show in Ver@@ sa@@ illes near Paris in late November 1990 .
__zh-cn__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__zh-cn__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pret@@ entious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__zh-cn__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__zh-cn__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__zh-cn__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__zh-cn__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__zh-cn__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__zh-cn__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hyper@@ text Conference .
__zh-cn__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andre@@ ess@@ en was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__zh-cn__ And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it .
__zh-cn__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the key@@ note speaker .
__zh-cn__ So that puts me in pretty illu@@ stri@@ ous company .
__zh-cn__ There was a guy called Dick Ro@@ we who was at Dec@@ ca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__zh-cn__ There was a guy called Gary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__zh-cn__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.@@ K. R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andre@@ ess@@ en who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__zh-cn__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__zh-cn__ But is he happy ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
__zh-cn__ And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
__zh-cn__ He was not a political prisoner .
__zh-cn__ He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
__zh-cn__ What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
__zh-cn__ And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
__zh-cn__ We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
__zh-cn__ It is for people who are in bro@@ ken@@ -down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
__zh-cn__ I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
__zh-cn__ First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
__zh-cn__ The second is insur@@ ing that there is systematic early access to counsel .
__zh-cn__ And the third is commitment .
__zh-cn__ So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
__zh-cn__ Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
__zh-cn__ And I founded International Bri@@ dges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
__zh-cn__ My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attor@@ neys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
__zh-cn__ And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
__zh-cn__ The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; in@@ audible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Kh@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with conf@@ essions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ essions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
__zh-cn__ And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
__zh-cn__ And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
__zh-cn__ She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
__zh-cn__ She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ carried .
__zh-cn__ And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
__zh-cn__ But Cambodia is not alone .
__zh-cn__ I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
__zh-cn__ Or is it other countries ?
__zh-cn__ But it is in so many countries .
__zh-cn__ In Bur@@ undi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8@@ -year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
__zh-cn__ Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
__zh-cn__ And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
__zh-cn__ And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
__zh-cn__ A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to coura@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
__zh-cn__ But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
__zh-cn__ For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; in@@ audible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Inno@@ cent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mum@@ bling
__zh-cn__ and grum@@ bling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
__zh-cn__ The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
__zh-cn__ I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were tor@@ turing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
__zh-cn__ And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Law@@ yers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
__zh-cn__ Pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors were perfectly trained .
__zh-cn__ But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
__zh-cn__ So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
__zh-cn__ And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
__zh-cn__ And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
__zh-cn__ The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not only Inno@@ cent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
__zh-cn__ We have a program called Jus@@ tice@@ Makers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
__zh-cn__ And there are 30 Jus@@ tice@@ Makers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swa@@ z@@ iland to the D@@ RC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paral@@ eg@@ al programs , through whatever they can do .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s not only these Jus@@ tice@@ Makers , but people we coura@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
__zh-cn__ So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
__zh-cn__ And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
__zh-cn__ This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
__zh-cn__ So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
__zh-cn__ We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
__zh-cn__ But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
__zh-cn__ And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
__zh-cn__ Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
__zh-cn__ It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
__zh-cn__ Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
__zh-cn__ I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vi@@ shna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bri@@ dges to Justice .
__zh-cn__ Vi@@ shna was a 4@@ -year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kand@@ al Prov@@ ince . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
__zh-cn__ So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vi@@ shna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
__zh-cn__ So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pin@@ kie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
__zh-cn__ You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
__zh-cn__ Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
__zh-cn__ And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vi@@ shna . He &apos;s a 4@@ -year-old boy .
__zh-cn__ He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
__zh-cn__ And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophe@@ tic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Picture this : It &apos;s Monday morning , you &apos;re at the office , you &apos;re settling in for the day at work , and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall , walks right into your cubicle and he ste@@ als your chair .
__zh-cn__ Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
__zh-cn__ Doesn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
__zh-cn__ Doesn &apos;t acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some work done today .
__zh-cn__ You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cubicle and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tuesday morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall , and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no information about why you were invited to the meeting .
__zh-cn__ And yet you accept the meeting invitation , and you go .
__zh-cn__ And when this highly unproductive session is over , you go back to your desk , and you stand at your desk and you say , &quot; &quot; Boy , I wish I had those two hours back , like I wish I had my chair back . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , we allow our coworkers , who are otherwise very , very nice people , to steal from us .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS : M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Syn@@ drome .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) The primary symptom of M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Syn@@ drome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your calendar , &quot; &quot; Got@@ ta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Me@@ etings are important , right ?
__zh-cn__ And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
__zh-cn__ And a well-@@ run meeting can yield really positive , ac@@ tionable results .
__zh-cn__ But between globalization and pervasive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;re miserable . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re miserable not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good meeting , it &apos;s because of MAS , our M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Syn@@ drome , which is a self-@@ inflicted wound .
__zh-cn__ Actually , I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic .
__zh-cn__ Let me tell you why .
__zh-cn__ A couple of years ago , I put a video on Youtube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you &apos;ve ever been on .
__zh-cn__ It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s the moder@@ ator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
__zh-cn__ There are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
__zh-cn__ The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck .
__zh-cn__ And everybody leaves very angry .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__zh-cn__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi , who just joined ?
__zh-cn__ Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
__zh-cn__ I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s skip the roll call and I &apos;m gonna dive right in .
__zh-cn__ Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__zh-cn__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — ( Laughter ) Hi , who just joined ?
__zh-cn__ No ? I thought I heard a beep . ( Laughter ) Sound familiar ?
__zh-cn__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__zh-cn__ A couple of weeks after I put that online , 500,000 people in dozens of countries , I mean dozens of countries , watched this video .
__zh-cn__ And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
__zh-cn__ And in fact , some of the biggest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my permission to use this video in their new@@ -@@ hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company .
__zh-cn__ And if the numbers — there are a million views and it &apos;s being used by all these companies — aren &apos;t enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings , there are the many , many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up .
__zh-cn__ Thousands of people wrote things like , &quot; OMG , that was my day today ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__zh-cn__ One guy wrote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s funny because it &apos;s true .
__zh-cn__ E@@ eri@@ ly , sadly , depres@@ singly true .
__zh-cn__ It made me laugh until I cried .
__zh-cn__ And cried . And I cried some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until retirement or death , sigh . &quot;
__zh-cn__ These are real quotes and it &apos;s real sad .
__zh-cn__ A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day .
__zh-cn__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__zh-cn__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Which , if I remember my high school Spanish , means something like , &quot; &quot; Enough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No MAS works . It &apos;s very simple .
__zh-cn__ First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the ten@@ tative button !
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
__zh-cn__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__zh-cn__ Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
__zh-cn__ Tell them you &apos;re very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you &apos;re interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
__zh-cn__ And if we do this often enough , and we do it respec@@ t@@ fully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
__zh-cn__ And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
__zh-cn__ People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
__zh-cn__ Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
__zh-cn__ People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
__zh-cn__ And they just might bring your chair back , too . ( Laughter ) No MAS !
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Di@@ vul@@ ge a personal secret . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Let me show you what I mean .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-@@ wave patterns .
__zh-cn__ But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
__zh-cn__ Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
__zh-cn__ Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
__zh-cn__ And I need you to be honest with the answer .
__zh-cn__ The audience will see right through you .
__zh-cn__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it whole@@ hear@@ tedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__zh-cn__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__zh-cn__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__zh-cn__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__zh-cn__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__zh-cn__ I could give you guys an alge@@ bra@@ -@@ two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__zh-cn__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__zh-cn__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__zh-cn__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__zh-cn__ For example , fac@@ toring quad@@ ra@@ tics with leading co@@ effici@@ ents greater than one .
__zh-cn__ This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__zh-cn__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__zh-cn__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__zh-cn__ all but en@@ sures they won &apos;t retain it .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calam@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__zh-cn__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__zh-cn__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
__zh-cn__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-@@ explain the entire thing at their desks .
__zh-cn__ Students lack perseverance .
__zh-cn__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-@@ explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__zh-cn__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__zh-cn__ This is really destructive .
__zh-cn__ David Mil@@ ch , creator of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__zh-cn__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ respect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__zh-cn__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ patience with ir@@ resolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__zh-cn__ You expect sit@@ com@@ -sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__zh-cn__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-@@ adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__zh-cn__ It applies equally to math .
__zh-cn__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__zh-cn__ I believe in real life .
__zh-cn__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__zh-cn__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s ham@@ str@@ inging students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__zh-cn__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just sw@@ apping out numbers and twe@@ aking the context a little bit .
__zh-cn__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it help@@ fully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__zh-cn__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__zh-cn__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about defining steep@@ ness and slope using a ski lift .
__zh-cn__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__zh-cn__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__zh-cn__ You have sub@@ steps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steep@@ est .
__zh-cn__ So I hope you can see .
__zh-cn__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congrat@@ ulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__zh-cn__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__zh-cn__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steep@@ est ?
__zh-cn__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__zh-cn__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journ@@ aling , whatever .
__zh-cn__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__zh-cn__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__zh-cn__ And then as we start to define what does steep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__zh-cn__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__zh-cn__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__zh-cn__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steep@@ ness thing .
__zh-cn__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those sub@@ steps together .
__zh-cn__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__zh-cn__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__zh-cn__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__zh-cn__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__zh-cn__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__zh-cn__ First things first , we eliminate all the sub@@ steps .
__zh-cn__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__zh-cn__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__zh-cn__ None of it &apos;s a distr@@ actor , so we lose that .
__zh-cn__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__zh-cn__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__zh-cn__ So now we have a water tank .
__zh-cn__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__zh-cn__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__zh-cn__ So now we have the real deal .
__zh-cn__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__zh-cn__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agon@@ iz@@ ingly slowly .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s tedious .
__zh-cn__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the hook , right ?
__zh-cn__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intr@@ o , I teach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I teach the kids that are the most remedi@@ al , all right ?
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__zh-cn__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__zh-cn__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversa@@ tionally intimid@@ ated joining the conversation .
__zh-cn__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__zh-cn__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__zh-cn__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__zh-cn__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__zh-cn__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-@@ installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__zh-cn__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re no longer intimid@@ ated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__zh-cn__ This has been a lot of fun .
__zh-cn__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__zh-cn__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__zh-cn__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__zh-cn__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__zh-cn__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__zh-cn__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__zh-cn__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__zh-cn__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__zh-cn__ Math makes sense of the world .
__zh-cn__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__zh-cn__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__zh-cn__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Interpreter : Piano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favorite musical symbol .
__zh-cn__ It means to play softly .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .
__zh-cn__ Two p &apos;s — even softer .
__zh-cn__ Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
__zh-cn__ This is my drawing of a p-@@ tree , which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never reach complete silence .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s my current definition of silence : a very obscure sound .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language , ASL , plus a bit of my own background .
__zh-cn__ French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s , and as time went by , mixed with local signs , it evolved into the language we know today as ASL .
__zh-cn__ So it has a history of about 200 years .
__zh-cn__ I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
__zh-cn__ And I believed it to be true .
__zh-cn__ Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
__zh-cn__ Sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
__zh-cn__ So how is it that I understand sound ?
__zh-cn__ Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
__zh-cn__ You people are like my loud@@ speakers , and amplify sound .
__zh-cn__ I learn and mirror that behavior .
__zh-cn__ At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
__zh-cn__ Thus I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
__zh-cn__ &quot; Don &apos;t slam the door ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the pot@@ at@@ o-c@@ hip bag ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re eating , make sure you don &apos;t scrape your utensils on the plate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I term &quot; &quot; sound etiquette . &quot; &quot; Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m hyper-@@ vigil@@ ant around sound .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
__zh-cn__ Hence , this drawing .
__zh-cn__ T@@ BD , to be decided .
__zh-cn__ T@@ BC , to be continued .
__zh-cn__ T@@ BA , to be announced .
__zh-cn__ And you notice the staff — there are no notes contained in the lines .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smu@@ dges and s@@ me@@ ars .
__zh-cn__ In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
__zh-cn__ This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__zh-cn__ A typical staff contains five lines .
__zh-cn__ Yet for me , signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why you &apos;ll notice in my drawings , I stick to four lines on paper .
__zh-cn__ In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
__zh-cn__ Pri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a painter .
__zh-cn__ During this summer , I visited different museums and gallery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there .
__zh-cn__ At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
__zh-cn__ Now sound has come into my art territory .
__zh-cn__ Is it going to further distance me from art ?
__zh-cn__ I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
__zh-cn__ I actually know sound .
__zh-cn__ I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
__zh-cn__ It could be felt t@@ actually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
__zh-cn__ So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
__zh-cn__ And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn .
__zh-cn__ I started creating a new body of work .
__zh-cn__ And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received .
__zh-cn__ I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social currency .
__zh-cn__ In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
__zh-cn__ And sound is so powerful that it could either disem@@ power me and my artwork , or it could empower me .
__zh-cn__ I chose to be empowered .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
__zh-cn__ And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
__zh-cn__ So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
__zh-cn__ And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relev@@ ancy in society today .
__zh-cn__ So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpre@@ ters .
__zh-cn__ And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
__zh-cn__ They help me to be heard .
__zh-cn__ And their voices hold value and currency .
__zh-cn__ Ironically , by borrowing out their voices , I &apos;m able to maintain a temporary form of currency , kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate .
__zh-cn__ If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fade off into obli@@ vion and not maintain any form of social currency .
__zh-cn__ So with sound as my new art medium , I del@@ ved into the world of music .
__zh-cn__ And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
__zh-cn__ For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper .
__zh-cn__ And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re both highly spatial and highly infl@@ ected — meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works .
__zh-cn__ So , envision a piano .
__zh-cn__ ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
__zh-cn__ If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano — such as facial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano — English is a linear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time .
__zh-cn__ However , ASL is more like a chord — all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL .
__zh-cn__ If just one of those keys were to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
__zh-cn__ The same applies to music in regards to pitch , tone and volume .
__zh-cn__ In ASL , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .
__zh-cn__ For example , take the sign T@@ O-@@ LO@@ O@@ K-@@ AT .
__zh-cn__ This is the sign T@@ O-@@ LO@@ O@@ K-@@ AT .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m looking at you .
__zh-cn__ St@@ aring at you .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — busted . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Uh-@@ oh .
__zh-cn__ What are you looking at ?
__zh-cn__ Aw , stop .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
__zh-cn__ For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun rises and sets .
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visually it looks like a piece of music .
__zh-cn__ All ... day .
__zh-cn__ I feel the same holds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
__zh-cn__ This is AL@@ L-@@ NI@@ G@@ H@@ T , represented in this drawing .
__zh-cn__ And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; overnight , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mus@@ icality than the other two . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .
__zh-cn__ For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present tense happens closest and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back .
__zh-cn__ So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Then &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) &quot; Common time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure .
__zh-cn__ Yet when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So notice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand .
__zh-cn__ We have the staff across the head and the chest .
__zh-cn__ &#91; Head : R@@ H , Flash claw &#93; &#91; Common time &#93; &#91; Ch@@ est : L@@ H , Flash claw &#93; I &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the &quot; &quot; flash claw . &quot; &quot; Can you please follow along with me ?
__zh-cn__ Everybody , hands up .
__zh-cn__ Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time .
__zh-cn__ Yes , got it .
__zh-cn__ That means &quot; &quot; to fall in love &quot; &quot; in International &#91; Sign &#93; .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) International &#91; Sign &#93; , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world .
__zh-cn__ The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
__zh-cn__ And now this .
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now the third — please follow along again .
__zh-cn__ And again .
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s do all three together .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Notice how all three signs are very similar , they all happen at the head and the chest , but they convey quite different meanings .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving , just like music is .
__zh-cn__ However , in this day and age , we live in a very audi@@ o@@ -centric world .
__zh-cn__ And just because ASL has no sound to it , it automatically holds no social currency .
__zh-cn__ We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency — without sound .
__zh-cn__ And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
__zh-cn__ And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be deaf to learn ASL , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
__zh-cn__ ASL is such a rich treasure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
__zh-cn__ And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__zh-cn__ Den@@ ise Kah@@ l@@ er-@@ Bra@@ aten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s produced by the Qu@@ ad@@ ro Corporation of West Virginia .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__zh-cn__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__zh-cn__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hu@@ b@@ cap , it &apos;s because it is .
__zh-cn__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ cap ready to go .
__zh-cn__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__zh-cn__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__zh-cn__ I actually went to see this one .
__zh-cn__ There was a lot of people there .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__zh-cn__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__zh-cn__ Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
__zh-cn__ But then the great famine began in 1994 .
__zh-cn__ I was four years old .
__zh-cn__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__zh-cn__ I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
__zh-cn__ Hun@@ ger is humiliation . Hun@@ ger is hopelessness .
__zh-cn__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__zh-cn__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__zh-cn__ But even as a child , I could feel the heav@@ iness in their hearts .
__zh-cn__ Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
__zh-cn__ I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
__zh-cn__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__zh-cn__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__zh-cn__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__zh-cn__ But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
__zh-cn__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__zh-cn__ Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
__zh-cn__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__zh-cn__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__zh-cn__ But that is no way to survive .
__zh-cn__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__zh-cn__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
__zh-cn__ Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
__zh-cn__ I was not uncommon .
__zh-cn__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__zh-cn__ When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
__zh-cn__ That hope kept me alive .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__zh-cn__ I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__zh-cn__ Hope kept me alive .
__zh-cn__ Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
__zh-cn__ After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
__zh-cn__ I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
__zh-cn__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__zh-cn__ I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
__zh-cn__ I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
__zh-cn__ North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
__zh-cn__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__zh-cn__ I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
__zh-cn__ I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
__zh-cn__ I was 16 years old .
__zh-cn__ I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
__zh-cn__ I thought more people would help me .
__zh-cn__ But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
__zh-cn__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__zh-cn__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__zh-cn__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__zh-cn__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__zh-cn__ Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__zh-cn__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__zh-cn__ Tex@@ t@@ books and the library were not my playground .
__zh-cn__ My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
__zh-cn__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__zh-cn__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__zh-cn__ So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__zh-cn__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__zh-cn__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__zh-cn__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__zh-cn__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__zh-cn__ I was so happy .
__zh-cn__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__zh-cn__ He just looked back at me very war@@ mly , but said no words .
__zh-cn__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__zh-cn__ My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
__zh-cn__ I felt so suffoc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__zh-cn__ My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
__zh-cn__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__zh-cn__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
__zh-cn__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__zh-cn__ You have to make it yourself .
__zh-cn__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__zh-cn__ Hope brought me to America .
__zh-cn__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__zh-cn__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__zh-cn__ I did not come here by myself .
__zh-cn__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__zh-cn__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__zh-cn__ North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
__zh-cn__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__zh-cn__ This is my message to you .
__zh-cn__ Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
__zh-cn__ Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
__zh-cn__ My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
__zh-cn__ In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
__zh-cn__ A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
__zh-cn__ But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Joseph@@ s who are still having hope to survive .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
__zh-cn__ I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
__zh-cn__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__zh-cn__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__zh-cn__ N@@ una , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__zh-cn__ I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
__zh-cn__ And I — oh , gosh .
__zh-cn__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__zh-cn__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__zh-cn__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__zh-cn__ AH : Sure , please .
__zh-cn__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__zh-cn__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__zh-cn__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__zh-cn__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__zh-cn__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__zh-cn__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__zh-cn__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-@@ visu@@ ally-@@ impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squ@@ ig@@ gly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__zh-cn__ So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ket@@ master , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scal@@ pers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__zh-cn__ CAPTCH@@ As are used all over the Internet .
__zh-cn__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__zh-cn__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__zh-cn__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__zh-cn__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__zh-cn__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__zh-cn__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Mell@@ lon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__zh-cn__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__zh-cn__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__zh-cn__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__zh-cn__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__zh-cn__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCH@@ As are typed everyday by people around the world .
__zh-cn__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__zh-cn__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__zh-cn__ But then I started feeling bad .
__zh-cn__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__zh-cn__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCH@@ As .
__zh-cn__ So then I started feeling bad .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCH@@ As , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__zh-cn__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__zh-cn__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__zh-cn__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__zh-cn__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__zh-cn__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__zh-cn__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-@@ second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__zh-cn__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__zh-cn__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authentic@@ ating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__zh-cn__ So let me explain how this works .
__zh-cn__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__zh-cn__ Google has one . The Internet Arch@@ ive has one .
__zh-cn__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__zh-cn__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__zh-cn__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__zh-cn__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__zh-cn__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__zh-cn__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ CR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__zh-cn__ Now the problem is that O@@ CR is not perfect .
__zh-cn__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , O@@ CR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__zh-cn__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__zh-cn__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__zh-cn__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__zh-cn__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__zh-cn__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__zh-cn__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__zh-cn__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__zh-cn__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__zh-cn__ So this is how the system works .
__zh-cn__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__zh-cn__ So for example , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ master .
__zh-cn__ So every time you buy tickets on T@@ ic@@ ket@@ master , you help to digitize a book .
__zh-cn__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__zh-cn__ Twitter and about 3@@ 50,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__zh-cn__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__zh-cn__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCH@@ As on the Internet .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__zh-cn__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__zh-cn__ So funny things can happen .
__zh-cn__ For example , we presented this word .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__zh-cn__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__zh-cn__ So we get this . ( Text : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__zh-cn__ John@@ Ed@@ ward@@ s.com ( Text : Dam@@ n liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__zh-cn__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__zh-cn__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__zh-cn__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__zh-cn__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__zh-cn__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__zh-cn__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__zh-cn__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__zh-cn__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : cl@@ enched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funni@@ er .
__zh-cn__ ( Text : st@@ oned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleonto@@ logical sh@@ vis@@ le , they contain S@@ no@@ op Do@@ gg . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__zh-cn__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__zh-cn__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__zh-cn__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__zh-cn__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__zh-cn__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__zh-cn__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__zh-cn__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__zh-cn__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__zh-cn__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__zh-cn__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-@@ quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__zh-cn__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__zh-cn__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , sh@@ hhhh !
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__zh-cn__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__zh-cn__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Sever@@ in H@@ acker .
__zh-cn__ Okay , that &apos;s Sever@@ in H@@ acker .
__zh-cn__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__zh-cn__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is H@@ acker .
__zh-cn__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__zh-cn__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__zh-cn__ First of all , translating the Web .
__zh-cn__ So right now the Web is parti@@ tioned into multiple languages .
__zh-cn__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__zh-cn__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__zh-cn__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__zh-cn__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__zh-cn__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__zh-cn__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__zh-cn__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__zh-cn__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__zh-cn__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__zh-cn__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__zh-cn__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__zh-cn__ Actually it was a forum post .
__zh-cn__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__zh-cn__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__zh-cn__ This person starts apologi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__zh-cn__ So the next sentence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
__zh-cn__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__zh-cn__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__zh-cn__ ( Text : At often , the go@@ at-@@ time install a error is vom@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__zh-cn__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__zh-cn__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__zh-cn__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__zh-cn__ So back to the question .
__zh-cn__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__zh-cn__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__zh-cn__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__zh-cn__ We could do that .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__zh-cn__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__zh-cn__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__zh-cn__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__zh-cn__ So it would be very expensive .
__zh-cn__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__zh-cn__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__zh-cn__ The first one is a lack of bil@@ ingu@@ als .
__zh-cn__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bil@@ ingual enough to help us translate .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__zh-cn__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__zh-cn__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__zh-cn__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__zh-cn__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__zh-cn__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__zh-cn__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__zh-cn__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bil@@ ingu@@ als , and that is language education .
__zh-cn__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__zh-cn__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__zh-cn__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__zh-cn__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__zh-cn__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__zh-cn__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__zh-cn__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__zh-cn__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__zh-cn__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__zh-cn__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__zh-cn__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__zh-cn__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__zh-cn__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__zh-cn__ People really can learn a language with it .
__zh-cn__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__zh-cn__ So people really do learn a language .
__zh-cn__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__zh-cn__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__zh-cn__ As opposed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__zh-cn__ So people really do learn a language .
__zh-cn__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ ners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__zh-cn__ So let me show you one example .
__zh-cn__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__zh-cn__ The top is the German .
__zh-cn__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__zh-cn__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__zh-cn__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__zh-cn__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__zh-cn__ We combine the translations of multiple begin@@ ners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__zh-cn__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__zh-cn__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__zh-cn__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__zh-cn__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__zh-cn__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__zh-cn__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__zh-cn__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__zh-cn__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__zh-cn__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__zh-cn__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__zh-cn__ So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ tize this .
__zh-cn__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__zh-cn__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language .
__zh-cn__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__zh-cn__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__zh-cn__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__zh-cn__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__zh-cn__ So thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
__zh-cn__ And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
__zh-cn__ And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Phys@@ icians .
__zh-cn__ She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
__zh-cn__ And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
__zh-cn__ But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
__zh-cn__ The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
__zh-cn__ Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
__zh-cn__ So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
__zh-cn__ Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
__zh-cn__ In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
__zh-cn__ And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
__zh-cn__ Now , she had no idea what to look for .
__zh-cn__ This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
__zh-cn__ Had the children eaten boiled swee@@ ts ?
__zh-cn__ Had they consumed colored drinks ?
__zh-cn__ Did they eat fish and chips ?
__zh-cn__ Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
__zh-cn__ What time of life had they started school ?
__zh-cn__ And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
__zh-cn__ By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-@@ ra@@ yed when pregnant .
__zh-cn__ Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
__zh-cn__ Conven@@ tional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
__zh-cn__ It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
__zh-cn__ And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
__zh-cn__ Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lanc@@ et in 1956 .
__zh-cn__ People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
__zh-cn__ In fact , she need not have hur@@ ried .
__zh-cn__ It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical estab@@ lishments abandoned the practice of X-@@ ra@@ ying pregnant women .
__zh-cn__ The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
__zh-cn__ A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
__zh-cn__ Open@@ ness alone can &apos;t drive change .
__zh-cn__ So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
__zh-cn__ So , how did she know that she was right ?
__zh-cn__ Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
__zh-cn__ She worked with a statistician named George K@@ ne@@ ale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ So , Alice was very out@@ going and sociable , and George was a recl@@ use .
__zh-cn__ Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
__zh-cn__ George frankly preferred numbers to people .
__zh-cn__ But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought dis@@ confirmation .
__zh-cn__ Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crun@@ ching the data in order to disprove her .
__zh-cn__ He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
__zh-cn__ Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
__zh-cn__ I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
__zh-cn__ Alice and George were very good at conflict .
__zh-cn__ They saw it as thinking .
__zh-cn__ So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
__zh-cn__ Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
__zh-cn__ That means we have to resist the neuro@@ biological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
__zh-cn__ That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
__zh-cn__ And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
__zh-cn__ Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
__zh-cn__ And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
__zh-cn__ Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head@@ -to-@@ head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
__zh-cn__ But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
__zh-cn__ So how do organizations think ?
__zh-cn__ Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
__zh-cn__ In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
__zh-cn__ A@@ fra@@ id of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embro@@ iled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
__zh-cn__ Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
__zh-cn__ It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumph@@ antly did .
__zh-cn__ They can &apos;t think together .
__zh-cn__ And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
__zh-cn__ So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
__zh-cn__ Because it does take skill and practice , too .
__zh-cn__ If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
__zh-cn__ So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
__zh-cn__ And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
__zh-cn__ He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
__zh-cn__ He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
__zh-cn__ But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
__zh-cn__ So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
__zh-cn__ After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
__zh-cn__ But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
__zh-cn__ In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
__zh-cn__ And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
__zh-cn__ It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
__zh-cn__ So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
__zh-cn__ And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
__zh-cn__ Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer , except that like almost all whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
__zh-cn__ But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
__zh-cn__ And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
__zh-cn__ And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
__zh-cn__ They think of him as a leader .
__zh-cn__ So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
__zh-cn__ Well , the University of Del@@ ft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
__zh-cn__ I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
__zh-cn__ I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
__zh-cn__ The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
__zh-cn__ It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are will@@ fully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provo@@ kes .
__zh-cn__ But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
__zh-cn__ Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
__zh-cn__ But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
__zh-cn__ Open@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the beginning .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Ar@@ usha , Tanzania .
__zh-cn__ I spoke very briefly about one of my prou@@ dest creations .
__zh-cn__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__zh-cn__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__zh-cn__ I had never used a computer .
__zh-cn__ I had never seen an Internet .
__zh-cn__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__zh-cn__ My English lost , I wanted to vom@@ it .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many az@@ ung@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__zh-cn__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__zh-cn__ I would like to share that story today .
__zh-cn__ We have seven children in my family .
__zh-cn__ All sisters , excep@@ ting me .
__zh-cn__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__zh-cn__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__zh-cn__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__zh-cn__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__zh-cn__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__zh-cn__ Within five months all Mal@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to starve to death .
__zh-cn__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__zh-cn__ Only three swal@@ lows of n@@ sim@@ a for each one of us .
__zh-cn__ The food passes through our bodies .
__zh-cn__ We drop down to nothing .
__zh-cn__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__zh-cn__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__zh-cn__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__zh-cn__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__zh-cn__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__zh-cn__ So I went to a library .
__zh-cn__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__zh-cn__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__zh-cn__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__zh-cn__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__zh-cn__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__zh-cn__ P@@ ump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__zh-cn__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__zh-cn__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__zh-cn__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absor@@ ber , PVC pipes .
__zh-cn__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynam@@ o , I built my machine .
__zh-cn__ It was one light at first .
__zh-cn__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__zh-cn__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__zh-cn__ Que@@ ues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__zh-cn__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__zh-cn__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__zh-cn__ So , on stage that day in Ar@@ usha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__zh-cn__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__zh-cn__ God bless .
__zh-cn__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__zh-cn__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__zh-cn__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__zh-cn__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__zh-cn__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__zh-cn__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__zh-cn__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__zh-cn__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__zh-cn__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__zh-cn__ This is happening to us today .
__zh-cn__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__zh-cn__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__zh-cn__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__zh-cn__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__zh-cn__ We have three main groups .
__zh-cn__ We have online criminals .
__zh-cn__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimit@@ ry Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ ev in Ukraine .
__zh-cn__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__zh-cn__ These guys make money .
__zh-cn__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__zh-cn__ We actually have several cases of million@@ aires online , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aires , who made money with their attacks .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s Vladimir T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form T@@ art@@ u in Estonia .
__zh-cn__ This is Alfred Gon@@ zal@@ ez .
__zh-cn__ This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
__zh-cn__ This is Bj@@ orn Sund@@ in .
__zh-cn__ This is Matthew Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al-@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
__zh-cn__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking tro@@ j@@ ans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with key@@ lo@@ ggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__zh-cn__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14.@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__zh-cn__ Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__zh-cn__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__zh-cn__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__zh-cn__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__zh-cn__ Grou@@ ps like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__zh-cn__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__zh-cn__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__zh-cn__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__zh-cn__ DigiNotar is a Cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__zh-cn__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__zh-cn__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__zh-cn__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__zh-cn__ And his answer was yes .
__zh-cn__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__zh-cn__ Well DigiNotar is a C@@ .A.
__zh-cn__ They sell certificates .
__zh-cn__ What do you do with certificates ?
__zh-cn__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has ht@@ t@@ ps , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__zh-cn__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t sno@@ op on their discussions .
__zh-cn__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C@@ .A.
__zh-cn__ and issue rogue certificates .
__zh-cn__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__zh-cn__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__zh-cn__ Well in Egypt , the ri@@ oters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__zh-cn__ Among those papers , was this bin@@ der entitled &quot; &quot; F@@ IN@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ ER . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__zh-cn__ They had sold this tool for 2@@ 80,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__zh-cn__ The company headquarters are right here .
__zh-cn__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__zh-cn__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__zh-cn__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a tro@@ jan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__zh-cn__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__zh-cn__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__zh-cn__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__zh-cn__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a tro@@ jan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your pass@@ words .
__zh-cn__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__zh-cn__ Why should I worry ?
__zh-cn__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__zh-cn__ Priv@@ acy is imp@@ lied .
__zh-cn__ Priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
__zh-cn__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__zh-cn__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__zh-cn__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__zh-cn__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__zh-cn__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
__zh-cn__ This , for example , is my tumble dr@@ yer .
__zh-cn__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__zh-cn__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__zh-cn__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__zh-cn__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__zh-cn__ But I think this is quite clearly un@@ true .
__zh-cn__ Val@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
__zh-cn__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__zh-cn__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__zh-cn__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__zh-cn__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ constr@@ ued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reduc@@ ible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__zh-cn__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__zh-cn__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__zh-cn__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__zh-cn__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
__zh-cn__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__zh-cn__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__zh-cn__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__zh-cn__ Probably not .
__zh-cn__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__zh-cn__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__zh-cn__ And morality relates to these truths .
__zh-cn__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__zh-cn__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__zh-cn__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__zh-cn__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__zh-cn__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__zh-cn__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__zh-cn__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__zh-cn__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__zh-cn__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__zh-cn__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__zh-cn__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__zh-cn__ And these a@@ wait our discovery .
__zh-cn__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__zh-cn__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__zh-cn__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__zh-cn__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__zh-cn__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corpor@@ al punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and b@@ list@@ ers and even breaking the skin .
__zh-cn__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__zh-cn__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__zh-cn__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__zh-cn__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Pro@@ verbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__zh-cn__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__zh-cn__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpe@@ tually open to be re-con@@ str@@ ued .
__zh-cn__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__zh-cn__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__zh-cn__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__zh-cn__ As we just heard from Michael Spec@@ ter , it has changed over the years .
__zh-cn__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__zh-cn__ There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__zh-cn__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for re@@ vision , does not make it vacu@@ ous .
__zh-cn__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__zh-cn__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__zh-cn__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__zh-cn__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__zh-cn__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__zh-cn__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__zh-cn__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that admit of no exceptions .
__zh-cn__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__zh-cn__ Why would we think this ?
__zh-cn__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__zh-cn__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__zh-cn__ But it clearly adm@@ its some exceptions .
__zh-cn__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__zh-cn__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__zh-cn__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__zh-cn__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__zh-cn__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__zh-cn__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__zh-cn__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__zh-cn__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud den@@ iz@@ ens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__zh-cn__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smo@@ thered in this way ?
__zh-cn__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__zh-cn__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-@@ jud@@ g@@ mental about a practice like this ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__zh-cn__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__zh-cn__ Just let that fact deton@@ ate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__zh-cn__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__zh-cn__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__zh-cn__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a news@@ stand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__zh-cn__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__zh-cn__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__zh-cn__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__zh-cn__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues of one form or another .
__zh-cn__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__zh-cn__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__zh-cn__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__zh-cn__ But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__zh-cn__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__zh-cn__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__zh-cn__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__zh-cn__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abduc@@ ting and raping and tor@@ turing and killing young women .
__zh-cn__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profit@@ ably use one &apos;s time .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that adm@@ its of a real argument that potentially falls within the pur@@ view of science .
__zh-cn__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__zh-cn__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__zh-cn__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__zh-cn__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; Str@@ ing theory is bo@@ gus .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__zh-cn__ But this is just the point .
__zh-cn__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__zh-cn__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__zh-cn__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__zh-cn__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__zh-cn__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__zh-cn__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__zh-cn__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__zh-cn__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__zh-cn__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__zh-cn__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__zh-cn__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__zh-cn__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__zh-cn__ It seems to me , therefore , pat@@ ently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__zh-cn__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__zh-cn__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combus@@ tible material there .
__zh-cn__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing-@@ with@@ -@@ rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__zh-cn__ Language seems to be really important here .
__zh-cn__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__zh-cn__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female speci@@ al@@ ness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__zh-cn__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperi@@ alist ?
__zh-cn__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__zh-cn__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__zh-cn__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full bur@@ qa .
__zh-cn__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__zh-cn__ But can you reconcile that ?
__zh-cn__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__zh-cn__ Pa@@ int your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__zh-cn__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__zh-cn__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__zh-cn__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__zh-cn__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__zh-cn__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__zh-cn__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__zh-cn__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__zh-cn__ SH : Well yeah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly del@@ usi@@ onal belief system .
__zh-cn__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__zh-cn__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__zh-cn__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__zh-cn__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__zh-cn__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congres@@ s@@ woman Gabri@@ elle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__zh-cn__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her B@@ roc@@ a &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__zh-cn__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into so@@ bbing tears , and she starts so@@ bbing word@@ lessly into the arms of her therapist .
__zh-cn__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ unci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__zh-cn__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Got@@ t@@ fried Schlaug , one of the pre@@ eminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a propon@@ ent of a therapy called Mel@@ o@@ dic In@@ ton@@ ation Ther@@ ap@@ y , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__zh-cn__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were ap@@ ha@@ si@@ c , could not form sentences of three- or four-@@ word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Bir@@ th@@ day To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eag@@ les or the Rolling St@@ ones .
__zh-cn__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally re@@ wire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__zh-cn__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-@@ musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cere@@ bell@@ um , how music was becoming a neuropsy@@ chiat@@ ric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkin@@ sonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__zh-cn__ and how late-@@ stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chop@@ in at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__zh-cn__ But I had an ul@@ ter@@ ior motive of visiting Got@@ t@@ fried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__zh-cn__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Sel@@ ko@@ e , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Ho@@ des , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multi@@ drug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with dis@@ figuring cancers .
__zh-cn__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__zh-cn__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__zh-cn__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Z@@ ub@@ in Me@@ h@@ ta and the Israeli phil@@ harmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Got@@ t@@ fried Schlaug had studied as an organ@@ ist at the Vienna Conserv@@ atory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__zh-cn__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the M@@ CAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the este@@ em@@ ed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__zh-cn__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__zh-cn__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concer@@ t Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gusta@@ vo Du@@ da@@ mel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__zh-cn__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__zh-cn__ Nathaniel A@@ yers was a double bas@@ si@@ st at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thor@@ azine at Bel@@ lev@@ ue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__zh-cn__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for hom@@ elessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The So@@ lo@@ ist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__zh-cn__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my un@@ trained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__zh-cn__ Play@@ ing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__zh-cn__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__zh-cn__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bun@@ ker Hill .
__zh-cn__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Rom@@ antic German composer Robert Sch@@ umann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Sch@@ umann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__zh-cn__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as crimin@@ ally insane .
__zh-cn__ After one of our events at the P@@ att@@ on State Hospital in San Ber@@ nar@@ din@@ o , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__zh-cn__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the foot@@ lights , out of the tuxe@@ do tails , the musicians become the con@@ du@@ it for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__zh-cn__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__zh-cn__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__zh-cn__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brah@@ ms , or chamber music by Beethoven , comp@@ els us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsy@@ chiat@@ rist I@@ ain McG@@ il@@ ch@@ rist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__zh-cn__ And for those living in the most de@@ humanizing conditions of mental illness within hom@@ elessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__zh-cn__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Ke@@ ats , the Rom@@ antic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__zh-cn__ Ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__zh-cn__ And Ke@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__zh-cn__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__zh-cn__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__zh-cn__ I have not slept in weeks .
__zh-cn__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__zh-cn__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around da@@ zed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__zh-cn__ So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
__zh-cn__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__zh-cn__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slo@@ pe , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__zh-cn__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__zh-cn__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__zh-cn__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-@@ working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__zh-cn__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__zh-cn__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__zh-cn__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-@@ funded .
__zh-cn__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__zh-cn__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__zh-cn__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the work@@ week and clone the teachers .
__zh-cn__ And so we started talking about this .
__zh-cn__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__zh-cn__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__zh-cn__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__zh-cn__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__zh-cn__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__zh-cn__ And the idea was to put Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s — Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s Qu@@ ar@@ terly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__zh-cn__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__zh-cn__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__zh-cn__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__zh-cn__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__zh-cn__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a Chris W@@ are m@@ ural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in m@@ ural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__zh-cn__ So we rented this space .
__zh-cn__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__zh-cn__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ce@@ ilings and fluorescent lights .
__zh-cn__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , white@@ washed beams and it had the look — while we were renov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__zh-cn__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__zh-cn__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ like .
__zh-cn__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat sc@@ ur@@ vy .
__zh-cn__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__zh-cn__ Up at the top , you see the eye@@ patch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eye@@ patch , and then you have the paste@@ l and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mit@@ z@@ va@@ hs and whatever .
__zh-cn__ So we opened this place . And this is a v@@ at that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__zh-cn__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__zh-cn__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Prac@@ tical Jo@@ king with Pir@@ ates . &quot;
__zh-cn__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__zh-cn__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__zh-cn__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__zh-cn__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__zh-cn__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__zh-cn__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renov@@ ating this place .
__zh-cn__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__zh-cn__ I went to a dot@@ -c@@ om auction at a Ho@@ li@@ day In@@ n in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a stroke of a paddle .
__zh-cn__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__zh-cn__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__zh-cn__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tut@@ oring for Your English-@@ Rel@@ ated and Writ@@ ing-@@ Rel@@ ated Ne@@ eds — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__zh-cn__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__zh-cn__ And then somebody aler@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__zh-cn__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named N@@ inev@@ eh Cal@@ ig@@ ari , a long@@ time San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__zh-cn__ She took over as executive director .
__zh-cn__ Immediately , she made the in@@ roads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__zh-cn__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__zh-cn__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__zh-cn__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__zh-cn__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__zh-cn__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pe@@ w that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tu@@ tored .
__zh-cn__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__zh-cn__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ packs , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__zh-cn__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__zh-cn__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__zh-cn__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ enter@@ -@@ for-@@ Kid@@ s-@@ Th@@ at-@@ Ne@@ ed-@@ Mo@@ re-@@ Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__zh-cn__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__zh-cn__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__zh-cn__ And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder , computer-@@ next-@@ to@@ -computer with the students .
__zh-cn__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__zh-cn__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__zh-cn__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__zh-cn__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__zh-cn__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-@@ pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__zh-cn__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__zh-cn__ And that makes a happy family .
__zh-cn__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__zh-cn__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__zh-cn__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__zh-cn__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__zh-cn__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our ros@@ ter .
__zh-cn__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__zh-cn__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__zh-cn__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__zh-cn__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__zh-cn__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__zh-cn__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__zh-cn__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__zh-cn__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__zh-cn__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Ch@@ ec@@ ked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cin@@ dy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__zh-cn__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__zh-cn__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__zh-cn__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__zh-cn__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__zh-cn__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__zh-cn__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__zh-cn__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor ros@@ ter .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__zh-cn__ Who@@ ever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__zh-cn__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__zh-cn__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s actually the br@@ unt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__zh-cn__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__zh-cn__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Ever@@ ett Middle School Writ@@ ers &apos; R@@ oom , where we decorated it in buc@@ can@@ e@@ er style .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__zh-cn__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Stra@@ igh@@ t-@@ Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor G@@ av@@ in New@@ som in both languages — English and Spanish .
__zh-cn__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__zh-cn__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thur@@ good Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__zh-cn__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paper@@ back form .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the book@@ stores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__zh-cn__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__zh-cn__ We had a big party at the end .
__zh-cn__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__zh-cn__ You can see Amy T@@ an sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__zh-cn__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__zh-cn__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five dra@@ fts , six dra@@ fts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__zh-cn__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__zh-cn__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__zh-cn__ We sell all the student books .
__zh-cn__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__zh-cn__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the store actually made money .
__zh-cn__ So it was paying the rent .
__zh-cn__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__zh-cn__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__zh-cn__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__zh-cn__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__zh-cn__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__zh-cn__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__zh-cn__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tu@@ tored .
__zh-cn__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__zh-cn__ So the store actually did really well .
__zh-cn__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__zh-cn__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__zh-cn__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__zh-cn__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And a lot of them had been former educators or w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__zh-cn__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__zh-cn__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__zh-cn__ So , knowing the cri@@ me-@@ fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Super@@ hero Sup@@ ply Company .
__zh-cn__ This is Sam Pot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
__zh-cn__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those key@@ smith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__zh-cn__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Cos@@ t@@ co for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__zh-cn__ These are all handmade .
__zh-cn__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__zh-cn__ All the packaging is done by Sam Pot@@ ts .
__zh-cn__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__zh-cn__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__zh-cn__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__zh-cn__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__zh-cn__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__zh-cn__ This is a secret identity kit .
__zh-cn__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Ho@@ bo@@ ken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dos@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__zh-cn__ So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el-@@ graded steps and then we turn on three hydra@@ u@@ lic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bun@@ ching up or something like that .
__zh-cn__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__zh-cn__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__zh-cn__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__zh-cn__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__zh-cn__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-@@ bon@@ o .
__zh-cn__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ oughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__zh-cn__ And this switch is flic@@ ked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__zh-cn__ This is one of the students , Khaled Ham@@ dan .
__zh-cn__ You can read this quote .
__zh-cn__ Ad@@ dic@@ ted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__zh-cn__ C@@ ame in . Got this concentrated attention .
__zh-cn__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__zh-cn__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__zh-cn__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__zh-cn__ He co-@@ wrote a mock@@ um@@ entary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super@@ -@@ Has@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Pengu@@ in Bal@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__zh-cn__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__zh-cn__ This is L.A. , The E@@ cho Park Time Tra@@ vel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-@@ Eleven for time travelers .
__zh-cn__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-@@ Eleven would be .
__zh-cn__ Le@@ eches . Mam@@ moth chunks . They even have their own S@@ lur@@ pee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Or@@ der . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__zh-cn__ These are spaces that are only affili@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pitts@@ field , Massachusetts ; In@@ k S@@ pot in C@@ inc@@ innat@@ i ; Youth Spe@@ aks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin B@@ at Ca@@ ve in Austin ; Figh@@ ting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Rod@@ dy Do@@ yle , this will be open in April .
__zh-cn__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__zh-cn__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__zh-cn__ Pro@@ found leaps forward !
__zh-cn__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__zh-cn__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__zh-cn__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__zh-cn__ We created a website .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ dees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__zh-cn__ We hope that you will take the lead in part@@ n@@ ering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__zh-cn__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__zh-cn__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__zh-cn__ There are a million ways .
__zh-cn__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__zh-cn__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__zh-cn__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__zh-cn__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__zh-cn__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__zh-cn__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__zh-cn__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__zh-cn__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__zh-cn__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureauc@@ ra@@ tically un@@ ten@@ able .
__zh-cn__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__zh-cn__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__zh-cn__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical person@@ hood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__zh-cn__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__zh-cn__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__zh-cn__ Thank you so much .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__zh-cn__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__zh-cn__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__zh-cn__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hall@@ elu@@ jah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__zh-cn__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__zh-cn__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__zh-cn__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__zh-cn__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__zh-cn__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__zh-cn__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__zh-cn__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__zh-cn__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__zh-cn__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__zh-cn__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point R@@ eyes Station in Inver@@ ness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__zh-cn__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__zh-cn__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__zh-cn__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__zh-cn__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the poll@@ l@@ ution .
__zh-cn__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__zh-cn__ I called my parents up .
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__zh-cn__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__zh-cn__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__zh-cn__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__zh-cn__ And so I did .
__zh-cn__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__zh-cn__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__zh-cn__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__zh-cn__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__zh-cn__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__zh-cn__ And then I would launch in .
__zh-cn__ Well , that just ended communication .
__zh-cn__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__zh-cn__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__zh-cn__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__zh-cn__ I didn ’ t .
__zh-cn__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__zh-cn__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reass@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__zh-cn__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__zh-cn__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__zh-cn__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__zh-cn__ I walked up to Ash@@ land , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__zh-cn__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__zh-cn__ And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ I had a newspaper cli@@ pping .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__zh-cn__ You don ’ t … ?
__zh-cn__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__zh-cn__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__zh-cn__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__zh-cn__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__zh-cn__ I walked all the way up to Port To@@ w@@ n@@ send , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Pu@@ get Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Mis@@ sou@@ la , Montana .
__zh-cn__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__zh-cn__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__zh-cn__ There are two stories in Montana .
__zh-cn__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__zh-cn__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one credit .
__zh-cn__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ vers and lakes , the hydro@@ logical systems , South America .
__zh-cn__ So I did that .
__zh-cn__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can mat@@ ricul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ ricul@@ ating , so you can use the library .
__zh-cn__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__zh-cn__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__zh-cn__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__zh-cn__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__zh-cn__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__zh-cn__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__zh-cn__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__zh-cn__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__zh-cn__ They had to take that class with me .
__zh-cn__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__zh-cn__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__zh-cn__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clear@@ cut with a ... &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__zh-cn__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__zh-cn__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__zh-cn__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__zh-cn__ And so I went on .
__zh-cn__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__zh-cn__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__zh-cn__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__zh-cn__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__zh-cn__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__zh-cn__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__zh-cn__ My dad came out again .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__zh-cn__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__zh-cn__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__zh-cn__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__zh-cn__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__zh-cn__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__zh-cn__ And that ’ s communication .
__zh-cn__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__zh-cn__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__zh-cn__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__zh-cn__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__zh-cn__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__zh-cn__ I worked for the Co@@ ast@@ guard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__zh-cn__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__zh-cn__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__zh-cn__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__zh-cn__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__zh-cn__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__zh-cn__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__zh-cn__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__zh-cn__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__zh-cn__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__zh-cn__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__zh-cn__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__zh-cn__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__zh-cn__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__zh-cn__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__zh-cn__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__zh-cn__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ apor@@ te , pas@@ apor@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 pointed at me .
__zh-cn__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ sport , huh ?
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__zh-cn__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__zh-cn__ The road turned into the jungle .
__zh-cn__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__zh-cn__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Al@@ mighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__zh-cn__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__zh-cn__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__zh-cn__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__zh-cn__ Now how could that be ?
__zh-cn__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__zh-cn__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__zh-cn__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__zh-cn__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__zh-cn__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__zh-cn__ You know , we can do it .
__zh-cn__ I was going to have to change .
__zh-cn__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__zh-cn__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__zh-cn__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__zh-cn__ But I know I needed to .
__zh-cn__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__zh-cn__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__zh-cn__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__zh-cn__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__zh-cn__ We have to change now .
__zh-cn__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__zh-cn__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__zh-cn__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__zh-cn__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__zh-cn__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__zh-cn__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
__zh-cn__ And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of dece@@ it , intrigue .
__zh-cn__ And like all good so@@ aps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-@@ over game .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
__zh-cn__ But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
__zh-cn__ Cr@@ icket wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed-@@ driven generations game .
__zh-cn__ There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
__zh-cn__ And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
__zh-cn__ And it only ended because the English cr@@ icke@@ ters had to go from D@@ urban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
__zh-cn__ So , the match was ended in between .
__zh-cn__ And one of the English bat@@ smen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__zh-cn__ Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
__zh-cn__ There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
__zh-cn__ But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
__zh-cn__ You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
__zh-cn__ And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
__zh-cn__ The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
__zh-cn__ Prin@@ ces patron@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ing@@ rati@@ ating themselves to the British rulers .
__zh-cn__ But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
__zh-cn__ Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
__zh-cn__ Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
__zh-cn__ But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
__zh-cn__ You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-@@ over cricket .
__zh-cn__ And then an enormous accident took place .
__zh-cn__ In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
__zh-cn__ And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
__zh-cn__ And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-@@ over game , and we played it virtually every day .
__zh-cn__ There was more 50-@@ over cricket than anywhere .
__zh-cn__ But there was another big date .
__zh-cn__ 1983 was when we won the World Cup .
__zh-cn__ 1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
__zh-cn__ And so we allowed multin@@ ation@@ als into India .
__zh-cn__ We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per@@ -cap@@ ita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
__zh-cn__ And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
__zh-cn__ The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
__zh-cn__ And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ avi D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
__zh-cn__ And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
__zh-cn__ And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing rich@@ es in .
__zh-cn__ Tele@@ vision started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
__zh-cn__ The next rights are sold for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
__zh-cn__ And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
__zh-cn__ England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
__zh-cn__ Thank God for them .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
__zh-cn__ India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
__zh-cn__ But we were forced to play it by an 8@@ -1 margin .
__zh-cn__ And then something very dramatic happened .
__zh-cn__ We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
__zh-cn__ ( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani bat@@ sman trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
__zh-cn__ Announcer : And Z@@ ish@@ an takes it ! India wins !
__zh-cn__ What a match for a Tw@@ enty@@ 20 final .
__zh-cn__ India , the world champions .
__zh-cn__ ( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
__zh-cn__ But what a game we had , M. S. D@@ hon@@ i got it right in the air , but Mis@@ ba@@ h-@@ ul@@ -@@ Ha@@ q , what a player .
__zh-cn__ A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
__zh-cn__ Har@@ sha B@@ ho@@ gle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-@@ overs cricket .
__zh-cn__ The accident , of course , there , was that the bat@@ sman thought the bow@@ ler was bowling fast .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) If he had bow@@ led fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
__zh-cn__ And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
__zh-cn__ It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
__zh-cn__ And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
__zh-cn__ And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gr@@ acious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
__zh-cn__ It was not like re@@ engineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
__zh-cn__ Six weeks , city versus city .
__zh-cn__ It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
__zh-cn__ One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
__zh-cn__ The other was Indian cricket .
__zh-cn__ Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
__zh-cn__ But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
__zh-cn__ America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glit@@ zy leagues here in India . &quot;
__zh-cn__ But was India ready for it ?
__zh-cn__ Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
__zh-cn__ It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
__zh-cn__ And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
__zh-cn__ All of a sudden , you had that happening .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
__zh-cn__ This was an India that was buying Cor@@ v@@ ettes . This was an India that was buying J@@ agu@@ ar .
__zh-cn__ This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
__zh-cn__ So , it was a different India .
__zh-cn__ But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
__zh-cn__ And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the cheer@@ leaders arrived .
__zh-cn__ Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old prin@@ ces .
__zh-cn__ They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
__zh-cn__ And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
__zh-cn__ And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
__zh-cn__ I mean the IP@@ L had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bow@@ led , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franch@@ ises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
__zh-cn__ But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
__zh-cn__ So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
__zh-cn__ All along , if you wanted a young cr@@ icke@@ ter , you picked him up from the by@@ lanes of your own little loc@@ ality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cr@@ icke@@ ters .
__zh-cn__ Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kal@@ ba@@ dev@@ i or Shi@@ va@@ ji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
__zh-cn__ This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
__zh-cn__ And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awak@@ ened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
__zh-cn__ So , the Mumbai Indians flew in D@@ way@@ ne Bra@@ vo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West In@@ dies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
__zh-cn__ went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West In@@ dies in time .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
__zh-cn__ Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ ston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
__zh-cn__ We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
__zh-cn__ There is cricket and the movies .
__zh-cn__ And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
__zh-cn__ And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
__zh-cn__ They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Ru@@ kh Khan .
__zh-cn__ And something very interesting happened .
__zh-cn__ We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
__zh-cn__ And so it started resem@@ bling the Indian movies more and more .
__zh-cn__ And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
__zh-cn__ So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Ru@@ kh playing the Kol@@ kata crowd .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;d all seen matches in Kol@@ kata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Ru@@ kh , with the Beng@@ ali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kol@@ kata — not for India , but for Kol@@ kata .
__zh-cn__ But take a look at this .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cr@@ icke@@ ter because they &apos;d won in Kol@@ kata .
__zh-cn__ Can you imagine ?
__zh-cn__ And do you know what the Pakistani cr@@ icke@@ ter said ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
__zh-cn__ We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
__zh-cn__ So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ layers are being bought and sold ?
__zh-cn__ Are they grain ?
__zh-cn__ Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
__zh-cn__ How do you fix a price for a player ?
__zh-cn__ And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so@@ -and-@@ so player . &quot;
__zh-cn__ There it is .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) A@@ uc@@ tion@@ e@@ er : Going at 1,@@ 500,000 dollars . Ch@@ en@@ na@@ i .
__zh-cn__ Sh@@ ane War@@ ne sold for 450,000 dollars .
__zh-cn__ H@@ B : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
__zh-cn__ The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internation@@ als , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 2@@ 20,000 dollars in a whole year .
__zh-cn__ Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
__zh-cn__ Then Andrew F@@ lin@@ toff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lam@@ par@@ d and Steven Ger@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m earning more than the foot@@ ball@@ ers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
__zh-cn__ Could you have imagined that day would come ?
__zh-cn__ One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
__zh-cn__ So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bow@@ led .
__zh-cn__ What India was doing , though , was bench@@ marking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
__zh-cn__ L@@ al@@ it Mo@@ di was on the cover of Business Today .
__zh-cn__ IP@@ L became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
__zh-cn__ Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
__zh-cn__ But we did it . You know why ?
__zh-cn__ Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
__zh-cn__ Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
__zh-cn__ For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beg@@ gars , snake char@@ mers , fil@@ th , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
__zh-cn__ And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
__zh-cn__ C@@ ric@@ ke@@ ters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And that felt good , you know ?
__zh-cn__ We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ gars , all the snake char@@ mers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
__zh-cn__ Right so , finally , an English game that India us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
__zh-cn__ If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
__zh-cn__ Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket comment@@ ators more time in the business .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
__zh-cn__ This is 26@@ th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__zh-cn__ Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__zh-cn__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__zh-cn__ B@@ locks have names .
__zh-cn__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__zh-cn__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
__zh-cn__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__zh-cn__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__zh-cn__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__zh-cn__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__zh-cn__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__zh-cn__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__zh-cn__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__zh-cn__ So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__zh-cn__ And this map is also accurate .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__zh-cn__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__zh-cn__ D@@ omo ar@@ ig@@ ato go@@ z@@ aim@@ ash@@ ita .
__zh-cn__ So when I meet refugees , I always ask them questions .
__zh-cn__ Who bombed your house ?
__zh-cn__ Who killed your son ?
__zh-cn__ Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
__zh-cn__ On his way to school , he would dodge snipers .
__zh-cn__ It was time to flee .
__zh-cn__ They left that day , right away , in their car , Hany hidden in the back because they were facing check@@ points of men@@ ac@@ ing soldiers .
__zh-cn__ And they would cross the border into Lebanon , where they would find peace .
__zh-cn__ It only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s not a town , a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees .
__zh-cn__ What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children .
__zh-cn__ I took this picture of this little girl .
__zh-cn__ And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon .
__zh-cn__ And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
__zh-cn__ I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children , a generation isolated and frustrated .
__zh-cn__ And yet , look at what they fled : utter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
__zh-cn__ Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
__zh-cn__ Refu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
__zh-cn__ Well far from it .
__zh-cn__ Hany was into his second year in lim@@ bo when I went to visit him recently , and we conducted our entire conversation in English , which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown &apos;s novels and from listening to American rap .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;ll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day .
__zh-cn__ He said to me , &quot; If I am not a student , I am nothing . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And there are more and more victims .
__zh-cn__ They flee across borders like this one .
__zh-cn__ How about a place of healing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
__zh-cn__ So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__zh-cn__ But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive .
__zh-cn__ We can help them thrive .
__zh-cn__ And imagine living in this camp .
__zh-cn__ I visited this camp .
__zh-cn__ It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
__zh-cn__ And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And I also thought , what a waste .
__zh-cn__ He watched — this is in Sudan — as his village — he was only seven years old — burned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day .
__zh-cn__ So I want to take you back to Hany .
__zh-cn__ He wrote : &quot; &quot; I miss myself , my friends , times of reading novels or writing poems , birds and tea in the morning .
__zh-cn__ Oh , oh , I had so many dreams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity .
__zh-cn__ I believe how we treat the upro@@ oted will shape the future of our world .
__zh-cn__ Hany is at a tipping point .
__zh-cn__ University is a luxury .
__zh-cn__ Hany &apos;s story is a tragedy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requ@@ isite focus on climate .
__zh-cn__ And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistre@@ at@@ ment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
__zh-cn__ That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
__zh-cn__ As an industrial engineer , c@@ um aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
__zh-cn__ After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepher@@ ding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Haw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The Eco@@ logy of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
__zh-cn__ In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
__zh-cn__ And by the way he convicted me as a pl@@ underer of the earth .
__zh-cn__ And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petro@@ le@@ um-@@ intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
__zh-cn__ Take nothing : do no harm .
__zh-cn__ I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Haw@@ ken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
__zh-cn__ Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ax@@ i@@ omatic . Why not us ?
__zh-cn__ And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering pl@@ underer .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
__zh-cn__ And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
__zh-cn__ They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
__zh-cn__ From pl@@ underer to recovering pl@@ underer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
__zh-cn__ As@@ ked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
__zh-cn__ And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
__zh-cn__ But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstr@@ able alternative to the take-@@ make@@ -@@ waste industrial system that so domin@@ ates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an inciner@@ ator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
__zh-cn__ According to Paul and Anne E@@ hrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
__zh-cn__ That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
__zh-cn__ And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
__zh-cn__ So the equation is conceptual .
__zh-cn__ Still it works to help us understand the problem .
__zh-cn__ So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petro@@ le@@ um-@@ intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
__zh-cn__ Paul and Anne E@@ hrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
__zh-cn__ I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
__zh-cn__ Now , the mathema@@ tically-@@ minded will see immediately that T in the numer@@ ator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
__zh-cn__ So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numer@@ ator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T@@ 2 — where it reduces impact ?
__zh-cn__ I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
__zh-cn__ Ex@@ trac@@ tive : taking raw materials from the earth .
__zh-cn__ L@@ inear : take , make , waste .
__zh-cn__ Power@@ ed by fossil fuel-@@ derived energy .
__zh-cn__ Wa@@ ste@@ ful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
__zh-cn__ More carpet per man-@@ hour .
__zh-cn__ Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
__zh-cn__ In the new industrial revolution extrac@@ tive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste@@ -free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
__zh-cn__ And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
__zh-cn__ And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
__zh-cn__ We have measured our progress very ri@@ gor@@ ously .
__zh-cn__ So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
__zh-cn__ Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute ton@@ nage .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
__zh-cn__ So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
__zh-cn__ This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global techn@@ osphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
__zh-cn__ F@@ ossi@@ l fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
__zh-cn__ The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
__zh-cn__ Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
__zh-cn__ Down 40 percent in our broad@@ loom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
__zh-cn__ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
__zh-cn__ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
__zh-cn__ We have diver@@ ted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-con@@ sum@@ er recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
__zh-cn__ Those new cyclical technologies have contributed migh@@ tily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climat@@ e-@@ neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life re@@ clamation — independent third-party certified .
__zh-cn__ We call it Cool Carpet .
__zh-cn__ And it has been a powerful marketplace differenti@@ ator , increasing sales and profits .
__zh-cn__ Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Fl@@ or , mis@@ spelled F-@@ L-@@ O-@@ R .
__zh-cn__ You can point and click today at Flor@@ .com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
__zh-cn__ It is practical , and pretty too .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
__zh-cn__ We call this Mission Zero .
__zh-cn__ And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
__zh-cn__ A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
__zh-cn__ Here is the business case for sustainability .
__zh-cn__ From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
__zh-cn__ This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
__zh-cn__ And this disp@@ els a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
__zh-cn__ Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected well@@ spring of innovation .
__zh-cn__ Our people are galvan@@ ized around this shared higher purpose .
__zh-cn__ You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
__zh-cn__ And the good@@ will of the marketplace is astonishing .
__zh-cn__ No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much good@@ will .
__zh-cn__ Cos@@ ts , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
__zh-cn__ It is a better business model .
__zh-cn__ And here is our 14@@ -year record of sales and profits .
__zh-cn__ There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
__zh-cn__ But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
__zh-cn__ We literally gained market share .
__zh-cn__ We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
__zh-cn__ If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t think so .
__zh-cn__ I remain troubled by the re@@ vised E@@ hrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T@@ 2 .
__zh-cn__ That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
__zh-cn__ But what if we re@@ framed E@@ hrlich further ?
__zh-cn__ And what if we made A a lower@@ case &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
__zh-cn__ You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
__zh-cn__ But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
__zh-cn__ Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
__zh-cn__ At Interface we really intend to bring this prototyp@@ ical sustainable , zero-@@ footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
__zh-cn__ We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
__zh-cn__ And now the challenge is in execution .
__zh-cn__ And as my good friend and adviser Am@@ ory Lov@@ ins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
__zh-cn__ If we , a petro@@ -@@ intensive company can do it , anybody can .
__zh-cn__ And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
__zh-cn__ Haw@@ ken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued un@@ checked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
__zh-cn__ Who is that person ?
__zh-cn__ Not you . Not I.
__zh-cn__ But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
__zh-cn__ And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
__zh-cn__ On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
__zh-cn__ But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
__zh-cn__ He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
__zh-cn__ And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
__zh-cn__ Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
__zh-cn__ Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
__zh-cn__ Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday mor@@ n .
__zh-cn__ A wise friend introduced us two .
__zh-cn__ And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
__zh-cn__ Knowing you has changed my thinking .
__zh-cn__ For I never had an ink@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
__zh-cn__ Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
__zh-cn__ Be@@ gin , I will .
__zh-cn__ The way the cost of what I squ@@ ander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
__zh-cn__ We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
__zh-cn__ The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
__zh-cn__ And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
__zh-cn__ For you , it &apos;s your call .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
