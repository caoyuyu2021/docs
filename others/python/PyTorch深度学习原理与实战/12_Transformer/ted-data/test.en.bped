__zh-cn__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__zh-cn__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__zh-cn__ While that might be a somewhat mor@@ bid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__zh-cn__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post auth@@ ored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__zh-cn__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__zh-cn__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the puni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__zh-cn__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__zh-cn__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__zh-cn__ There are 200 million Twee@@ ts being posted every day .
__zh-cn__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__zh-cn__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__zh-cn__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__zh-cn__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__zh-cn__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__zh-cn__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__zh-cn__ One of them actually , fit@@ tingly enough , found me when I checked into a del@@ i at a restaurant in New York on four@@ square .
__zh-cn__ ( Rec@@ ording ) Adam O@@ st@@ row : Hello .
__zh-cn__ Death : Adam ?
__zh-cn__ AO : Yeah .
__zh-cn__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organ@@ ic .
__zh-cn__ AO : Who is this ?
__zh-cn__ Death : Go to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Adam O@@ st@@ row : Kind of creepy , right ?
__zh-cn__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__zh-cn__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Mem@@ ories .
__zh-cn__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__zh-cn__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__zh-cn__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with De@@ b Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__zh-cn__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Twee@@ ts , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__zh-cn__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__zh-cn__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__zh-cn__ One service called My Next Tweet analy@@ zes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__zh-cn__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat com@@ ical .
__zh-cn__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__zh-cn__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__zh-cn__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__zh-cn__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN be@@ amed a live hologram of hip hop artist will@@ .@@ i.@@ am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__zh-cn__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__zh-cn__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__zh-cn__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .

__zh-cn__ People returning to work after a career break : I call them rela@@ un@@ chers .
__zh-cn__ These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
__zh-cn__ C@@ los@@ ely related are career transi@@ tioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , reti@@ re@@ es coming out of retirement or re@@ patri@@ ating exp@@ ats .
__zh-cn__ Re@@ turning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the rela@@ un@@ chers .
__zh-cn__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__zh-cn__ Now , successful rela@@ un@@ chers are everywhere and in every field .
__zh-cn__ This is S@@ ami Kaf@@ ala .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
__zh-cn__ And speaking of long career breaks , this is M@@ imi Kahn .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s a social worker in Orange County , California , who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25@@ -year career break .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the longest career break that I &apos;m aware of .
__zh-cn__ Supreme Court Justice Sand@@ ra Day O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor took a five-year career break early in her career .
__zh-cn__ And this is Tr@@ acy Sh@@ ap@@ iro , who took a 13@@ -year career break .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ acy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ acy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ acy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
__zh-cn__ She was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very dilig@@ ently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
__zh-cn__ I met Tr@@ acy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
__zh-cn__ The first thing I told Tr@@ acy was she had to get out of the house .
__zh-cn__ I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__zh-cn__ I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
__zh-cn__ Ex@@ p@@ ect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
__zh-cn__ There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tr@@ acy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce .
__zh-cn__ And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
__zh-cn__ What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
__zh-cn__ This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my mini@@ van .
__zh-cn__ Or here I am in the kitchen .
__zh-cn__ But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
__zh-cn__ They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
__zh-cn__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__zh-cn__ My background is in finance , and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children .
__zh-cn__ So I was afraid I &apos;d go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
__zh-cn__ So I had to re@@ subscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again .
__zh-cn__ I believe rela@@ un@@ chers are a ge@@ m of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__zh-cn__ Think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
__zh-cn__ We did that already .
__zh-cn__ We have fewer sp@@ ous@@ al or partner job re@@ locations .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
__zh-cn__ We have great work experience .
__zh-cn__ We have a more mature perspective .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__zh-cn__ Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
__zh-cn__ The first one is , employers are worried that rela@@ un@@ chers are technologically obsolete .
__zh-cn__ Now , I can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a temporary condition .
__zh-cn__ I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lot@@ us 1-2-3 .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on Exc@@ el .
__zh-cn__ It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the commands are the same .
__zh-cn__ I found PowerPoint much more challenging , but now I use PowerPoint all the time .
__zh-cn__ I tell rela@@ un@@ chers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
__zh-cn__ And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
__zh-cn__ And they do .
__zh-cn__ The second area of concern that employers have about rela@@ un@@ chers is they &apos;re worried that rela@@ un@@ chers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
__zh-cn__ I tell rela@@ un@@ chers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the rela@@ un@@ cher &apos;s responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
__zh-cn__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__zh-cn__ I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an intern@@ ship@@ -like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
__zh-cn__ I saw Goldman Sachs and Sar@@ a Lee start corporate re@@ entry internship programs .
__zh-cn__ I saw a returning engineer , a non@@ traditional re@@ entry candidate , apply for an entr@@ y-@@ level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
__zh-cn__ So I wrote a report about what I was seeing , and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The 40-@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ Old Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there for that title , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-@@ year-old intern in the midst of all the college inter@@ ns .
__zh-cn__ And then , courtesy of Fox Business News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; The 50-@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ Old Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the biggest financial services companies have re@@ entry internship programs for returning finance professionals .
__zh-cn__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__zh-cn__ These intern@@ ships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
__zh-cn__ And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are pil@@ oting re@@ entry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engine@@ ers .
__zh-cn__ Now , why are companies embracing the re@@ entry internship ?
__zh-cn__ Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews , and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over .
__zh-cn__ This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring rela@@ un@@ chers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hi@@ res .
__zh-cn__ Think about how far we have come .
__zh-cn__ But now , not only are programs being developed specifically with rela@@ un@@ chers in mind , but you can &apos;t even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résum@@ é .
__zh-cn__ This is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for rela@@ un@@ chers , we can solve it for other career transi@@ tioners too .
__zh-cn__ In fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their re@@ entry internship program .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a reti@@ ree internship program .
__zh-cn__ Different pool , same concept .
__zh-cn__ So let me tell you what happened with Tr@@ acy Sh@@ ap@@ iro .
__zh-cn__ Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__zh-cn__ Well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tr@@ acy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
__zh-cn__ But it was a tem@@ p job .
__zh-cn__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ acy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
__zh-cn__ So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
__zh-cn__ Well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Tr@@ acy could handle .
__zh-cn__ Fast forward to 2015 , Tr@@ acy &apos;s been promoted .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve paid for her to get her MBA at night .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s even hired another rela@@ un@@ cher to work for her .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ acy &apos;s tem@@ p job was a try@@ out , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tr@@ acy and her employer .
__zh-cn__ Now , my goal is to bring the re@@ entry internship concept to more and more employers .
__zh-cn__ But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hes@@ itate to suggest an internship or an intern@@ ship@@ -like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal re@@ entry internship program .
__zh-cn__ Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more rela@@ un@@ chers to come .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__zh-cn__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__zh-cn__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__zh-cn__ ... paying attention to crowd-@@ sourcing .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__zh-cn__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__zh-cn__ It might take a moment to load .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Solar technology is ...
__zh-cn__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__zh-cn__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
__zh-cn__ I was working at the AC@@ L@@ U as the organization &apos;s science advis@@ or .
__zh-cn__ So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
__zh-cn__ I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
__zh-cn__ That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
__zh-cn__ And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
__zh-cn__ So what does that mean ?
__zh-cn__ Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
__zh-cn__ But was there a way we could challenge them ?
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
__zh-cn__ And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 .
__zh-cn__ Why is that ?
__zh-cn__ There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
__zh-cn__ So the bottom line : courts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to over@@ turn these patents .
__zh-cn__ So we set out to build our case .
__zh-cn__ It had forced multiple labs that were offering B@@ RCA testing to stop .
__zh-cn__ This is K@@ athle@@ en Max@@ ian .
__zh-cn__ The test was negative .
__zh-cn__ So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
__zh-cn__ We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Swe@@ et .
__zh-cn__ In March 2010 , Judge Swe@@ et issued his opinion — 15@@ 2 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
__zh-cn__ And here things got really interesting .
__zh-cn__ First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
__zh-cn__ So in the district court the government submitted a brief on My@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
__zh-cn__ Sort of .
__zh-cn__ En@@ ds up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__zh-cn__ But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Br@@ y@@ son , agreed with us .
__zh-cn__ So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
__zh-cn__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__zh-cn__ Four words : Are human genes pat@@ ent@@ able ?
__zh-cn__ I was clearly more nervous than he was .
__zh-cn__ The argument itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
__zh-cn__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__zh-cn__ Justice Rober@@ ts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__zh-cn__ Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than My@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
__zh-cn__ But of course the decision goes far beyond My@@ ri@@ ad .
__zh-cn__ It clear@@ s a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
__zh-cn__ I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__zh-cn__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__zh-cn__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__zh-cn__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__zh-cn__ Where are economic networks ?
__zh-cn__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__zh-cn__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__zh-cn__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__zh-cn__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3,000 .
__zh-cn__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__zh-cn__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glim@@ p@@ ses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist S@@ oren P@@ ors .
__zh-cn__ We call ourselves P@@ ors and Ra@@ o , and we live and work in India .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__zh-cn__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__zh-cn__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__zh-cn__ And the situation that ir@@ ked me and mysti@@ fied me the most was his use of a land@@ line telephone .
__zh-cn__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__zh-cn__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__zh-cn__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__zh-cn__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephe@@ ws and nieces around the world as an email .
__zh-cn__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__zh-cn__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__zh-cn__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__zh-cn__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__zh-cn__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritu@@ alism , the way my uncle likes it .
__zh-cn__ The next work is a sound@@ -@@ sensitive installation that we affection@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The Pyg@@ mies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__zh-cn__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__zh-cn__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__zh-cn__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__zh-cn__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__zh-cn__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__zh-cn__ And we had over 500 of these little py@@ g@@ mies hiding behind them .
__zh-cn__ So this is how it works .
__zh-cn__ This is a video prototype .
__zh-cn__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__zh-cn__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__zh-cn__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after a@@ while .
__zh-cn__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__zh-cn__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__zh-cn__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__zh-cn__ So each py@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__zh-cn__ So this is a very early prototype .
__zh-cn__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__zh-cn__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and child@@ like with them .
__zh-cn__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Mis@@ sing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__zh-cn__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__zh-cn__ So we worked with a company that speci@@ alizes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__zh-cn__ On the right side you can see my colleague S@@ oren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__zh-cn__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__zh-cn__ S@@ oren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__zh-cn__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__zh-cn__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__zh-cn__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__zh-cn__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cut@@ out of a child@@ like drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__zh-cn__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__zh-cn__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__zh-cn__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
__zh-cn__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caric@@ ature of an upside-down man .
__zh-cn__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__zh-cn__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drun@@ ken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__zh-cn__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__zh-cn__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__zh-cn__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__zh-cn__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__zh-cn__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__zh-cn__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fat@@ alism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__zh-cn__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__zh-cn__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__zh-cn__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twink@@ le like the night sky .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__zh-cn__ So we wrapped this around a b@@ lob@@ -like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__zh-cn__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__zh-cn__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__zh-cn__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space F@@ iller . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to in@@ timi@@ date you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__zh-cn__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conce@@ al a secret within its seams or something .
__zh-cn__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__zh-cn__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__zh-cn__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m really glad to be here .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , because that would be a little weird .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
__zh-cn__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__zh-cn__ Or here .
__zh-cn__ But here .
__zh-cn__ I mean Earth .
__zh-cn__ And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this auditorium , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from mold to mushrooms to flying bears . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8.@@ 7 million species .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve looked other places , maybe not as hard as we should or we could , but we &apos;ve looked and haven &apos;t found any ; Earth is the only place we know of with life .
__zh-cn__ Is Earth special ?
__zh-cn__ To understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life , the first step is to understand what life here requires .
__zh-cn__ It turns out , of all of those 8.@@ 7 million species , life only needs three things .
__zh-cn__ On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
__zh-cn__ Comple@@ x life like us deri@@ ves our energy from the sun , but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions .
__zh-cn__ On the other side , all life needs food or nouri@@ shment .
__zh-cn__ And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent tomato .
__zh-cn__ Not mo@@ ose , but water .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Although mo@@ ose would be pretty cool . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ And not frozen water , and not water in a gas@@ eous state , but liquid water .
__zh-cn__ This is what life needs to survive , all life .
__zh-cn__ And many solar system bodies don &apos;t have liquid water , and so we don &apos;t look there .
__zh-cn__ Other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water , even more than Earth , but it &apos;s trapped beneath an icy shell , and so it &apos;s hard to access , it &apos;s hard to get to , it &apos;s hard to even find out if there &apos;s any life there .
__zh-cn__ So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s make the problem simpler for ourselves .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
__zh-cn__ There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system , with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet , and in order of distance from the sun , it &apos;s : Venus , Earth and Mars .
__zh-cn__ You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
__zh-cn__ You have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t have too much atmosphere , too thick or too warm an atmosphere , because then you end up too hot like Venus , and you can &apos;t have liquid water .
__zh-cn__ But if you have too little atmosphere and it &apos;s too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
__zh-cn__ So Venus is too hot , Mars is too cold , and Earth is just right .
__zh-cn__ You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a Gol@@ di@@ lock@@ s-@@ type problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it .
__zh-cn__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__zh-cn__ And the same is true with planets .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re not static things . They change .
__zh-cn__ They vary . They evolve .
__zh-cn__ And atmospheres do the same .
__zh-cn__ So let me give you an example .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not the highest resolution image , it &apos;s not the sex@@ iest image , it &apos;s not the most recent image , but it &apos;s an image that shows river@@ beds cut into the surface of the planet ; river@@ beds carved by flowing , liquid water ; river@@ beds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form .
__zh-cn__ This can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
__zh-cn__ The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid .
__zh-cn__ This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
__zh-cn__ And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable , because the three requirements for life were present long ago .
__zh-cn__ And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres .
__zh-cn__ Come@@ ts have tails that are incredibly visible remin@@ ders of atmospheric escape .
__zh-cn__ But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time , and Mars and Earth as well .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;d like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition .
__zh-cn__ How do atmospheres get their energy for escape ?
__zh-cn__ How do particles get enough energy to escape ?
__zh-cn__ There are two ways , if we &apos;re going to reduce things a little bit .
__zh-cn__ Number one , sunlight .
__zh-cn__ Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles .
__zh-cn__ Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my wedding . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ They get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming .
__zh-cn__ A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind .
__zh-cn__ This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it relates to habit@@ ability .
__zh-cn__ I mentioned that there were two things about the Gol@@ di@@ locks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about , and the second one is a little bit more subtle .
__zh-cn__ This thing that you &apos;ve accepted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
__zh-cn__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__zh-cn__ This has to play into habit@@ ability .
__zh-cn__ But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
__zh-cn__ Maybe it &apos;s the bow@@ ls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story , what is just right .
__zh-cn__ Earth has one ; Venus and Mars do not .
__zh-cn__ Mag@@ netic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth .
__zh-cn__ If you have a compass , you know which way north is .
__zh-cn__ Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
__zh-cn__ If you have a compass on Venus and Mars , congratulations , you &apos;re lost .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Does this influence habit@@ ability ?
__zh-cn__ Well , how might it ?
__zh-cn__ I like to think of it instead as a salad bar snee@@ ze guard for planets .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And yes , my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equ@@ ated with mucus . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Mars , on the other hand , has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field , and over billions of years , maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today .
__zh-cn__ Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sa@@ ils on a ship , enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
__zh-cn__ The sa@@ ils may gather energy from the solar wind .
__zh-cn__ The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;ve ever experienced them , it &apos;s magnificent .
__zh-cn__ We know the energy is getting in .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;ve posed a problem for you here , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t have a solution .
__zh-cn__ But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
__zh-cn__ Well , we &apos;ve sent spacecraft to all three planets .
__zh-cn__ Some of them are orbiting now , including the MA@@ V@@ EN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars , which I &apos;m involved with and which is led here , out of the University of Colorado .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
__zh-cn__ We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
__zh-cn__ Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , I care deeply ...
__zh-cn__ And financially as well , but deeply .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) First of all , an answer to this question will teach us more about these three planets , Venus , Earth and Mars , not only about how they interact with their environment today , but how they were billions of years ago , whether they were habitable long ago or not .
__zh-cn__ It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close .
__zh-cn__ But moreover , what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere , including planets that we &apos;re now observing around other stars .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to investigate first .
__zh-cn__ Any lever will help .
__zh-cn__ In fact , based on observations that Kepler &apos;s taken and other similar observations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
__zh-cn__ In addition to that , estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy .
__zh-cn__ We have the observations of those planets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are habitable yet .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them , wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
__zh-cn__ And so you have to use the tools that you &apos;ve developed around you for Venus , Earth and Mars , and you have to apply them to these other situations , and hope that you &apos;re making reasonable infer@@ ences from the data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets , and those that are not .
__zh-cn__ In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
__zh-cn__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__zh-cn__ But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
__zh-cn__ Thanks .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I love the Internet .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s true .
__zh-cn__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__zh-cn__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__zh-cn__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__zh-cn__ So let me show you something .
__zh-cn__ This here is Brain .
__zh-cn__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-@@ inch floppy disk infected by Bra@@ in@@ .A.
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__zh-cn__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__zh-cn__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__zh-cn__ All right .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dun@@ geon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad .
__zh-cn__ And Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__zh-cn__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__zh-cn__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__zh-cn__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__zh-cn__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__zh-cn__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am block at Al@@ l@@ ama I@@ q@@ bal Town .
__zh-cn__ And I knocked on the door .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__zh-cn__ Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Bas@@ it .
__zh-cn__ Sitting down is his brother Am@@ j@@ ad .
__zh-cn__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__zh-cn__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__zh-cn__ I asked them why .
__zh-cn__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__zh-cn__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__zh-cn__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__zh-cn__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__zh-cn__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__zh-cn__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__zh-cn__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__zh-cn__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__zh-cn__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__zh-cn__ For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de virus first .
__zh-cn__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de sc@@ rolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__zh-cn__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Cr@@ ash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__zh-cn__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__zh-cn__ ( Si@@ ren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__zh-cn__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__zh-cn__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobby@@ ists and teenagers .
__zh-cn__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobby@@ ists and teenagers .
__zh-cn__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__zh-cn__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__zh-cn__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__zh-cn__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Ser@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e.
__zh-cn__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__zh-cn__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__zh-cn__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__zh-cn__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__zh-cn__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ Buck@@ s@@ .com.
__zh-cn__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__zh-cn__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__zh-cn__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__zh-cn__ So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ tize those infected computers ?
__zh-cn__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking tro@@ j@@ ans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or key@@ lo@@ ggers .
__zh-cn__ Key@@ lo@@ ggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__zh-cn__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__zh-cn__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__zh-cn__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__zh-cn__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__zh-cn__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__zh-cn__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__zh-cn__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__zh-cn__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__zh-cn__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__zh-cn__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__zh-cn__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ tizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of IN@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ OL and search for wanted persons .
__zh-cn__ We find guys like Bj@@ orn Sund@@ in , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the IN@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ OL wanted pages , Mr. Sha@@ il@@ esh@@ ku@@ mar J@@ ain , a U.S. citizen .
__zh-cn__ These guys were running an operation called I.@@ M.@@ U. , a cybercrime operation through which they net@@ ted millions .
__zh-cn__ They are both right now on the run .
__zh-cn__ Nobody knows where they are .
__zh-cn__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. J@@ ain , and that bank account had 14.@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__zh-cn__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__zh-cn__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__zh-cn__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L databases .
__zh-cn__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precau@@ tions we can build .
__zh-cn__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__zh-cn__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__zh-cn__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Cl@@ ari@@ fied Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__zh-cn__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__zh-cn__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__zh-cn__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__zh-cn__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__zh-cn__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__zh-cn__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__zh-cn__ How do you actually track them down ?
__zh-cn__ Let me give you an example .
__zh-cn__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__zh-cn__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the He@@ x dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__zh-cn__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__zh-cn__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image head@@ er , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__zh-cn__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s dec@@ ryp@@ t it .
__zh-cn__ It has been encrypted with X@@ O@@ R function 97 .
__zh-cn__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__zh-cn__ And we can go here and actually start dec@@ ryp@@ ting it .
__zh-cn__ Well the yellow part of the code is now dec@@ ryp@@ ted .
__zh-cn__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__zh-cn__ But just keep staring at it .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .com / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
__zh-cn__ But even more interestingly , if we continue dec@@ ryp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 78@@ R@@ US .
__zh-cn__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__zh-cn__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__zh-cn__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__zh-cn__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__zh-cn__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__zh-cn__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in R@@ US like Russia .
__zh-cn__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Peter@@ sburg .
__zh-cn__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__zh-cn__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Peter@@ sburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__zh-cn__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Peter@@ sburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__zh-cn__ And he drives a very nice car .
__zh-cn__ In fact , this guy drives a Mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ Ben@@ z S@@ 600 V@@ 12 with a six-@@ liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__zh-cn__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-@@ something year-old kid in St. Peter@@ sburg .
__zh-cn__ How do I know about this car ?
__zh-cn__ Because he blo@@ gged about the car .
__zh-cn__ He actually had a car accident .
__zh-cn__ In downtown St. Peter@@ sburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__zh-cn__ And he put blo@@ gged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mer@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ada Sam@@ ara he crashed into .
__zh-cn__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Sam@@ ara ends in 78@@ R@@ US .
__zh-cn__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mer@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 78@@ R@@ US .
__zh-cn__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__zh-cn__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__zh-cn__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__zh-cn__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__zh-cn__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__zh-cn__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__zh-cn__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a Si@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7-@@ 400 P@@ LC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__zh-cn__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__zh-cn__ This is what runs everything around us .
__zh-cn__ P@@ LC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__zh-cn__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__zh-cn__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__zh-cn__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__zh-cn__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__zh-cn__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__zh-cn__ Everything is being run by computers .
__zh-cn__ Everything is reli@@ ant on these computers working .
__zh-cn__ We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__zh-cn__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__zh-cn__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So prepar@@ edness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about back@@ ups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__zh-cn__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__zh-cn__ Think about all the services we have online .
__zh-cn__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__zh-cn__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__zh-cn__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__zh-cn__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__zh-cn__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-@@ viruses or running fire@@ walls .
__zh-cn__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__zh-cn__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__zh-cn__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__zh-cn__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__zh-cn__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__zh-cn__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by B@@ NP Pari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__zh-cn__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__zh-cn__ The post@@ -c@@ risis projection is 2020 .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__zh-cn__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__zh-cn__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__zh-cn__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__zh-cn__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__zh-cn__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civiliz@@ ational roots .
__zh-cn__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modern@@ ize , they also we@@ ster@@ n@@ ize .
__zh-cn__ This is an illusion .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__zh-cn__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__zh-cn__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__zh-cn__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__zh-cn__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__zh-cn__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__zh-cn__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__zh-cn__ We can &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__zh-cn__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__zh-cn__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__zh-cn__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Q@@ in Dy@@ nasty in 2@@ 21 B.C. at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing-@@ state period — the birth of modern China .
__zh-cn__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__zh-cn__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dy@@ nasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__zh-cn__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__zh-cn__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civiliz@@ ation-@@ state .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Confuc@@ ian values and so on .
__zh-cn__ These are all things that come from the period of the civiliz@@ ation-@@ state .
__zh-cn__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civiliz@@ ation-@@ state , rather than as a nation-state .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ graphically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__zh-cn__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very plur@@ alistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__zh-cn__ So this is China , a civiliz@@ ation-@@ state , rather than a nation-state .
__zh-cn__ And what does it mean ?
__zh-cn__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__zh-cn__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__zh-cn__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__zh-cn__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__zh-cn__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very pain@@ fully holding this huge civilization , civiliz@@ ation-@@ state , together .
__zh-cn__ The second is maybe more pros@@ aic , which is Hong Kong .
__zh-cn__ Do you remember the han@@ do@@ ver of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__zh-cn__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__zh-cn__ One country , two systems .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll lay a w@@ ager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Win@@ dow dressing .
__zh-cn__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thir@@ teen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__zh-cn__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__zh-cn__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__zh-cn__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__zh-cn__ What happened ?
__zh-cn__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__zh-cn__ One nation , one system .
__zh-cn__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__zh-cn__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civiliz@@ ation-@@ state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__zh-cn__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__zh-cn__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__zh-cn__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__zh-cn__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__zh-cn__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most pop@@ ulous countries .
__zh-cn__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multi@@ racial .
__zh-cn__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__zh-cn__ China is only multi@@ racial really at the margins .
__zh-cn__ So the question is , why ?
__zh-cn__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civiliz@@ ation-@@ state .
__zh-cn__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , as@@ simil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__zh-cn__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__zh-cn__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__zh-cn__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__zh-cn__ They really believe in their own su@@ peri@@ ority , and they are dis@@ respectful of those who are not .
__zh-cn__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs and to the Tibe@@ tans .
__zh-cn__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__zh-cn__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__zh-cn__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__zh-cn__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjo@@ ys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__zh-cn__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__zh-cn__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjo@@ ys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guar@@ dian of Chinese civilization , of the civiliz@@ ation-@@ state .
__zh-cn__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__zh-cn__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__zh-cn__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__zh-cn__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__zh-cn__ Whereas we tend to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__zh-cn__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patri@@ arch of the family .
__zh-cn__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__zh-cn__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__zh-cn__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__zh-cn__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__zh-cn__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__zh-cn__ The state is everywhere in China .
__zh-cn__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__zh-cn__ Priv@@ ate firms , however large they are , like Len@@ ov@@ o , depend in many ways on state patron@@ age .
__zh-cn__ Tar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__zh-cn__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-c@@ hild policy .
__zh-cn__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of stat@@ ecraft .
__zh-cn__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__zh-cn__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__zh-cn__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__zh-cn__ It went for 1,@@ 114 miles , linking Beijing with H@@ ang@@ zhou and Shanghai .
__zh-cn__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infra@@ structural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three G@@ orges D@@ am and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__zh-cn__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civiliz@@ ation-@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__zh-cn__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__zh-cn__ If you want to know why we un@@ err@@ ingly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Wester@@ ner mentality .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__zh-cn__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__zh-cn__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__zh-cn__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__zh-cn__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmop@@ olitan of all cultures .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s not .
__zh-cn__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochi@@ al , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__zh-cn__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__zh-cn__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__zh-cn__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmop@@ olitan in many ways than the West .
__zh-cn__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__zh-cn__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__zh-cn__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asi@@ an@@ ers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__zh-cn__ Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__zh-cn__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__zh-cn__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 us@@ ur@@ ping very rapidly the position of the G@@ 7 , or the G8 .
__zh-cn__ And there are two consequences of this .
__zh-cn__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__zh-cn__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__zh-cn__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__zh-cn__ When did that last happen ?
__zh-cn__ I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__zh-cn__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__zh-cn__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or con@@ vers@@ ant with .
__zh-cn__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__zh-cn__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sle@@ ep@@ walking into obli@@ vion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__zh-cn__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once comman@@ ded the future in its confidence .
__zh-cn__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__zh-cn__ But this , al@@ as , is no longer true .
__zh-cn__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__zh-cn__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__zh-cn__ This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ han &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__zh-cn__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__zh-cn__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__zh-cn__ Here you have a meg@@ ab@@ us , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__zh-cn__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__zh-cn__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__zh-cn__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__zh-cn__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__zh-cn__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__zh-cn__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__zh-cn__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__zh-cn__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-@@ picture positive for this world .
__zh-cn__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__zh-cn__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__zh-cn__ Ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__zh-cn__ As human@@ ists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__zh-cn__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Z@@ hen@@ g He in the early 15th century on his great voy@@ ages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__zh-cn__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 13@@ 68 .
__zh-cn__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__zh-cn__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__zh-cn__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__zh-cn__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__zh-cn__ By revolution , I mean a dr@@ astic and far-@@ reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__zh-cn__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__zh-cn__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__zh-cn__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__zh-cn__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__zh-cn__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__zh-cn__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__zh-cn__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__zh-cn__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__zh-cn__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__zh-cn__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__zh-cn__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__zh-cn__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__zh-cn__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__zh-cn__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__zh-cn__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__zh-cn__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__zh-cn__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__zh-cn__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__zh-cn__ Last .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulg@@ arians are not optimistic about the future .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__zh-cn__ And these are facts , guys .
__zh-cn__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make@@ -@@ believe .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__zh-cn__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__zh-cn__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__zh-cn__ We need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__zh-cn__ How did this happen ?
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__zh-cn__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ astic to some of you — because we are handic@@ apping ourselves .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__zh-cn__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__zh-cn__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__zh-cn__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t value play .
__zh-cn__ In fact , we de@@ value play .
__zh-cn__ And we de@@ value it in three areas .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__zh-cn__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__zh-cn__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__zh-cn__ And instead , what do we value ?
__zh-cn__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__zh-cn__ To be serious .
__zh-cn__ To be really , really serious .
__zh-cn__ It did .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__zh-cn__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__zh-cn__ He@@ aven forbid they play in the dirt , the k@@ al , or even worse , lo@@ k@@ vi , water — that will kill them .
__zh-cn__ I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ a@@ dos that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__zh-cn__ We have a serious meme running through .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__zh-cn__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woo@@ hoo !
__zh-cn__ But then what happens in step three ?
__zh-cn__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coff@@ ees .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
__zh-cn__ But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__zh-cn__ So what happens ?
__zh-cn__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the red@@ wood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__zh-cn__ What happens then ?
__zh-cn__ It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values r@@ ote learning , memor@@ ization and standardi@@ zation , and de@@ values self-expression , self-@@ exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__zh-cn__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__zh-cn__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__zh-cn__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bol@@ ts in pre-@@ drilled holes .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__zh-cn__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t need mechan@@ ized workers .
__zh-cn__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__zh-cn__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__zh-cn__ What are qualities of a Bulg@@ arian work ?
__zh-cn__ Auto@@ cratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__zh-cn__ Un@@ trusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Con@@ trol@@ ling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ illion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__zh-cn__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.@@ M.
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s somehow un@@ professional and bad .
__zh-cn__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ fulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__zh-cn__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__zh-cn__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__zh-cn__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__zh-cn__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__zh-cn__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__zh-cn__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__zh-cn__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__zh-cn__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__zh-cn__ And you know what ?
__zh-cn__ Evolution does a really , really good job of des@@ elec@@ ting traits that aren &apos;t advant@@ age@@ ous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__zh-cn__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__zh-cn__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . An@@ ts play .
__zh-cn__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__zh-cn__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__zh-cn__ R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__zh-cn__ Kit@@ tens play . We all know kittens play .
__zh-cn__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__zh-cn__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__zh-cn__ Bears play .
__zh-cn__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__zh-cn__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__zh-cn__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__zh-cn__ Dolph@@ ins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__zh-cn__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__zh-cn__ Y@@ ours truly : humans .
__zh-cn__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__zh-cn__ Really cool term : ne@@ ot@@ eny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__zh-cn__ And who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
__zh-cn__ Humans . We play sports .
__zh-cn__ We do it for fun , or as Olym@@ pi@@ ans , or as professionals .
__zh-cn__ We play musical instruments .
__zh-cn__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just go@@ of around .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__zh-cn__ It is a huge benefit .
__zh-cn__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__zh-cn__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-@@ frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__zh-cn__ As a result , what happens ?
__zh-cn__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__zh-cn__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__zh-cn__ These guys are facts .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__zh-cn__ These are the benefits to play .
__zh-cn__ It is a genetic birth@@ right that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__zh-cn__ And if we handic@@ ap ourselves with play , we handic@@ ap ourselves as if we would with any other birth@@ right that we have .
__zh-cn__ We hold ourselves back .
__zh-cn__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__zh-cn__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__zh-cn__ What does this world look like ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
__zh-cn__ Now imagine your workplace .
__zh-cn__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__zh-cn__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__zh-cn__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__zh-cn__ Or is it crap ? Is it auto@@ cratic , controlling , restrictive and un@@ trusting and un@@ fulfilling ?
__zh-cn__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__zh-cn__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__zh-cn__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__zh-cn__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__zh-cn__ In fact , play improves our work .
__zh-cn__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__zh-cn__ For example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
__zh-cn__ It increases our openness to change .
__zh-cn__ It improves our ability to learn .
__zh-cn__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__zh-cn__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__zh-cn__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groo@@ ve , he &apos;s in the flow .
__zh-cn__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__zh-cn__ Our thinking is backwards .
__zh-cn__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__zh-cn__ We should be celebrating play .
__zh-cn__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__zh-cn__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__zh-cn__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__zh-cn__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__zh-cn__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__zh-cn__ And what do great customers do , great-@@ feeling customers ?
__zh-cn__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__zh-cn__ People , service , profit .
__zh-cn__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__zh-cn__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__zh-cn__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__zh-cn__ One , play is universal .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulg@@ arians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__zh-cn__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sci@@ ant .
__zh-cn__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__zh-cn__ Not one customer would refer us .
__zh-cn__ I asked them all .
__zh-cn__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__zh-cn__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__zh-cn__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-@@ direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not auto@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a resul@@ t@@ s-@@ focus .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__zh-cn__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__zh-cn__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__zh-cn__ Basically promoting fun .
__zh-cn__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sci@@ ant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__zh-cn__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the ran@@ kings for best employer for small business .
__zh-cn__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__zh-cn__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__zh-cn__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__zh-cn__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__zh-cn__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__zh-cn__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__zh-cn__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__zh-cn__ Re@@ discover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__zh-cn__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; We@@ ird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__zh-cn__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__zh-cn__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__zh-cn__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__zh-cn__ Let them be on the Internet .
__zh-cn__ Let them be on instant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
__zh-cn__ Let them take long lunches .
__zh-cn__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__zh-cn__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__zh-cn__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__zh-cn__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ acceptable . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__zh-cn__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__zh-cn__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__zh-cn__ of what worked about rein@@ vigor@@ ating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-@@ fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__zh-cn__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-@@ tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__zh-cn__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little aud@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__zh-cn__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__zh-cn__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__zh-cn__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__zh-cn__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__zh-cn__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a cont@@ emp@@ tuous glance , or maybe a very awkward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__zh-cn__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__zh-cn__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__zh-cn__ So obviously when we think about non@@ verbal behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ verb@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__zh-cn__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__zh-cn__ And we make sweeping judgments and infer@@ ences from body language .
__zh-cn__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__zh-cn__ For example , N@@ al@@ ini Am@@ b@@ ady , a researcher at Tu@@ fts University , shows that when people watch 30-@@ second sound@@ less clips of real phys@@ ici@@ an-@@ patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s nic@@ eness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__zh-cn__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__zh-cn__ We are also influenced by our non@@ verb@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__zh-cn__ So what non@@ verb@@ als am I talking about ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__zh-cn__ I became especially interested in non@@ verbal expressions of power and dominance .
__zh-cn__ And what are non@@ verbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__zh-cn__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__zh-cn__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__zh-cn__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tr@@ acy has studied .
__zh-cn__ We make ourselves small .
__zh-cn__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__zh-cn__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__zh-cn__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__zh-cn__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__zh-cn__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__zh-cn__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__zh-cn__ Women feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__zh-cn__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__zh-cn__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__zh-cn__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__zh-cn__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__zh-cn__ So it goes both ways .
__zh-cn__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__zh-cn__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__zh-cn__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__zh-cn__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more asser@@ tive and more confident , more optimistic .
__zh-cn__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__zh-cn__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__zh-cn__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__zh-cn__ So do you want the high-@@ power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__zh-cn__ Probably not , right ?
__zh-cn__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__zh-cn__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__zh-cn__ Here are a couple more .
__zh-cn__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__zh-cn__ And here are the low-power poses .
__zh-cn__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__zh-cn__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__zh-cn__ So this is what happens .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__zh-cn__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ sol .
__zh-cn__ So it seems that our non@@ verb@@ als do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__zh-cn__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__zh-cn__ And so we think where you want to use this is evalu@@ ative situations , like social threat situations .
__zh-cn__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__zh-cn__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being hec@@ k@@ led .
__zh-cn__ People hate this .
__zh-cn__ We then have these co@@ ders look at these tapes , four of them .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__zh-cn__ These kinds of things .
__zh-cn__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
__zh-cn__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
__zh-cn__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__zh-cn__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__zh-cn__ I was thrown from the car .
__zh-cn__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__zh-cn__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__zh-cn__ I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__zh-cn__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__zh-cn__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__zh-cn__ So she had changed .
__zh-cn__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__zh-cn__ Fa@@ ke it till you become it .
__zh-cn__ Do it enough until you actually become it and intern@@ alize .
__zh-cn__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__zh-cn__ T@@ iny twe@@ aks can lead to big changes .
__zh-cn__ So , this is two minutes .
__zh-cn__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__zh-cn__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cor@@ ti@@ sol down .
__zh-cn__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__zh-cn__ Dis@@ cus@@ s . Great creativity is astonishingly , absur@@ dly , rationally , ir@@ rationally powerful .
__zh-cn__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__zh-cn__ Great creativity can make politicians elec@@ table , or parties un@@ elec@@ table .
__zh-cn__ It can make war seem like tragedy or far@@ ce .
__zh-cn__ Creativity is the meme-@@ maker that puts slogans on our t-@@ shirts and phrases on our lips .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the path@@ finder that shows us a simple road through an impenetr@@ able moral maze .
__zh-cn__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less know@@ able , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__zh-cn__ This is a time of need .
__zh-cn__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__zh-cn__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__zh-cn__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scr@@ aps .
__zh-cn__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__zh-cn__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__zh-cn__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__zh-cn__ A deer with an itch@@ y leg . A flying motorcycle .
__zh-cn__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__zh-cn__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__zh-cn__ The woman who as a child had ski@@ pped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__zh-cn__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__zh-cn__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__zh-cn__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gu@@ sty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 300 yards from here .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford und@@ res@@ sed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__zh-cn__ Gu@@ sty entered her bol@@ dly and made love to her rhyth@@ mically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur porno@@ grapher .
__zh-cn__ The earth moved for both of them .
__zh-cn__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__zh-cn__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Andy H@@ obs@@ b@@ aw@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__zh-cn__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__zh-cn__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__zh-cn__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__zh-cn__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__zh-cn__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Be@@ au Lot@@ to : So , this game is very simple .
__zh-cn__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__zh-cn__ Okay , one , two , three@@ .@@ Audience : Can you read this ?
__zh-cn__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three@@ .@@ Audience : You are not reading this .
__zh-cn__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__zh-cn__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__zh-cn__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__zh-cn__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__zh-cn__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__zh-cn__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__zh-cn__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__zh-cn__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__zh-cn__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__zh-cn__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__zh-cn__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__zh-cn__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__zh-cn__ They begin with a question .
__zh-cn__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__zh-cn__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__zh-cn__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seas@@ ick@@ ness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__zh-cn__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__zh-cn__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__zh-cn__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__zh-cn__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__zh-cn__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__zh-cn__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__zh-cn__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s play .
__zh-cn__ Now play is not simply a process . Exper@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__zh-cn__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Un@@ certainty is what makes play fun .
__zh-cn__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__zh-cn__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__zh-cn__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__zh-cn__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__zh-cn__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__zh-cn__ And who better to ask than 25 e@@ ight@@ - to 10-year-old children ?
__zh-cn__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Dev@@ on , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__zh-cn__ The first step was to ask a question .
__zh-cn__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__zh-cn__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__zh-cn__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__zh-cn__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__zh-cn__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__zh-cn__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__zh-cn__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__zh-cn__ Now she is the person@@ i@@ fication of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__zh-cn__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Black@@ aw@@ ton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__zh-cn__ Amy O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , Be@@ au . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__zh-cn__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__zh-cn__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__zh-cn__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__zh-cn__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__zh-cn__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-@@ then rule .
__zh-cn__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__zh-cn__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__zh-cn__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__zh-cn__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Be@@ au , had no idea whether it would work .
__zh-cn__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : In@@ clu@@ ding the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave S@@ tru@@ d@@ wick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) Dave S@@ tru@@ d@@ wick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5@@ C .
__zh-cn__ Dave S@@ tru@@ d@@ wick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__zh-cn__ Dave S@@ tru@@ d@@ wick : So you keep track of e@@ ach@@ .@@ Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__zh-cn__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__zh-cn__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__zh-cn__ And three in here .
__zh-cn__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__zh-cn__ They do the simple mathematics , aver@@ aging , etc . , etc .
__zh-cn__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__zh-cn__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__zh-cn__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__zh-cn__ Me@@ tho@@ ds , what did you do ? Res@@ ults , what was the observation ?
__zh-cn__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kid@@ speak .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Tra@@ ining phase , the puzzle ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ hhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__zh-cn__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__zh-cn__ The first author is Black@@ aw@@ ton Pri@@ mary School , because if it were ever refer@@ enced , it would be &quot; &quot; Black@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in cray@@ on , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to D@@ ale Pur@@ ves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Larry Mal@@ oney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__zh-cn__ The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__zh-cn__ They say no .
__zh-cn__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hem@@ pel to write a commentary situ@@ ating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology L@@ et@@ ters .
__zh-cn__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent refer@@ ees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typ@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__zh-cn__ What was the feedback like ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__zh-cn__ It was the Ed@@ itors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology L@@ et@@ ters .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__zh-cn__ Last year , it was the second-@@ most downloaded paper by Biology L@@ et@@ ters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Black@@ aw@@ ton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__zh-cn__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__zh-cn__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and ze@@ al are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__zh-cn__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__zh-cn__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__zh-cn__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__zh-cn__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__zh-cn__ Shim@@ on Sch@@ oc@@ ken : Right , but I like myself .
__zh-cn__ BL : This is the epit@@ ome of technology . Right . Okay .
__zh-cn__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__zh-cn__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__zh-cn__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ outs . One , two , three ?
__zh-cn__ Audience : ( Sh@@ outs ) ( Laughter ) ( Sh@@ outs ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__zh-cn__ Everyone over there shout . ( Sh@@ outs ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__zh-cn__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__zh-cn__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__zh-cn__ So , Amy ?
__zh-cn__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__zh-cn__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__zh-cn__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__zh-cn__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Be@@ au , and the Black@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e Project .
__zh-cn__ Thank you@@ .@@ BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical Environ@@ ment@@ alist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__zh-cn__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__zh-cn__ So get out your pen and paper .
__zh-cn__ Bot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__zh-cn__ There are 800 million people starving .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__zh-cn__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__zh-cn__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__zh-cn__ The lists go on and on .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__zh-cn__ There are many , many problems out there .
__zh-cn__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__zh-cn__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__zh-cn__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__zh-cn__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__zh-cn__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__zh-cn__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__zh-cn__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__zh-cn__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__zh-cn__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__zh-cn__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__zh-cn__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__zh-cn__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__zh-cn__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__zh-cn__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__zh-cn__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__zh-cn__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__zh-cn__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__zh-cn__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__zh-cn__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__zh-cn__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__zh-cn__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__zh-cn__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__zh-cn__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__zh-cn__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__zh-cn__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__zh-cn__ And one reason is that priori@@ tization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__zh-cn__ Nobody wants to do this .
__zh-cn__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__zh-cn__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__zh-cn__ And since there are many more not-@@ number-@@ one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__zh-cn__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not priori@@ tizing — any decision is a priori@@ tization , so of course we are still priori@@ tizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the priori@@ tization , and went in and talked about it .
__zh-cn__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__zh-cn__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__zh-cn__ We have not had an idea .
__zh-cn__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__zh-cn__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__zh-cn__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__zh-cn__ It could be a fam@@ ily-@@ size pizza ; it could be a very individu@@ al-@@ size pizza , right ?
__zh-cn__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__zh-cn__ And that is what the Copenhagen Con@@ sens@@ us is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__zh-cn__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Con@@ sens@@ us &apos; process .
__zh-cn__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__zh-cn__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__zh-cn__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__zh-cn__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__zh-cn__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__zh-cn__ What would be the price ?
__zh-cn__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__zh-cn__ And so on .
__zh-cn__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__zh-cn__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Real Mad@@ rid of economics .
__zh-cn__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__zh-cn__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__zh-cn__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__zh-cn__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__zh-cn__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__zh-cn__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climat@@ ologist .
__zh-cn__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__zh-cn__ That is what economists do .
__zh-cn__ They prioritize .
__zh-cn__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__zh-cn__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__zh-cn__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__zh-cn__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__zh-cn__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__zh-cn__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__zh-cn__ These were the bad projects .
__zh-cn__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__zh-cn__ This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__zh-cn__ Why is it it came up ?
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__zh-cn__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__zh-cn__ What they basically show us , the average of all macro@@ economic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__zh-cn__ Yet it would do very little good .
__zh-cn__ All models show it will postp@@ one warming for about six years in 2100 .
__zh-cn__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2@@ 106 .
__zh-cn__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__zh-cn__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__zh-cn__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__zh-cn__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__zh-cn__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__zh-cn__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__zh-cn__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__zh-cn__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__zh-cn__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__zh-cn__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__zh-cn__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__zh-cn__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__zh-cn__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__zh-cn__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__zh-cn__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__zh-cn__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__zh-cn__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__zh-cn__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__zh-cn__ This third best one was free trade .
__zh-cn__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,@@ 400 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Third World .
__zh-cn__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__zh-cn__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__zh-cn__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__zh-cn__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micr@@ on@@ u@@ tri@@ ents .
__zh-cn__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , i@@ od@@ ine and vitamin A.
__zh-cn__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe in@@ road into that problem .
__zh-cn__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__zh-cn__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__zh-cn__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__zh-cn__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__zh-cn__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__zh-cn__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__zh-cn__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__zh-cn__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__zh-cn__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__zh-cn__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__zh-cn__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__zh-cn__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__zh-cn__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__zh-cn__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__zh-cn__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__zh-cn__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__zh-cn__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__zh-cn__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__zh-cn__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__zh-cn__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__zh-cn__ And I think , actually — Thomas Sch@@ elling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__zh-cn__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__zh-cn__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__zh-cn__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__zh-cn__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__zh-cn__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__zh-cn__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__zh-cn__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__zh-cn__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__zh-cn__ Or as Sch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bo@@ li@@ vian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__zh-cn__ Even if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cord to the typical way we see this problem .
__zh-cn__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__zh-cn__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Em@@ mer@@ ich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__zh-cn__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Con@@ sens@@ us and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__zh-cn__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__zh-cn__ The other objec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — pos@@ iting a false choice .
__zh-cn__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__zh-cn__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__zh-cn__ Since then our aid has halved .
__zh-cn__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__zh-cn__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__zh-cn__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m all for that .
__zh-cn__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__zh-cn__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__zh-cn__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__zh-cn__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__zh-cn__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__zh-cn__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__zh-cn__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__zh-cn__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__zh-cn__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__zh-cn__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__zh-cn__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s been many other semin@@ ars and university students , and different things .
__zh-cn__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__zh-cn__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__zh-cn__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__zh-cn__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__zh-cn__ I see the Copenhagen Con@@ sens@@ us as a process .
__zh-cn__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__zh-cn__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
__zh-cn__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__zh-cn__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__zh-cn__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ The year is 1800 .
__zh-cn__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__zh-cn__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__zh-cn__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__zh-cn__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__zh-cn__ Fast forward 200 years .
__zh-cn__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__zh-cn__ Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
__zh-cn__ Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
__zh-cn__ You take a stain , like ac@@ ri@@ dine orange or a fluorescent stain or Gi@@ em@@ sa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
__zh-cn__ They all have faces .
__zh-cn__ Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fa@@ tim@@ a in Bangladesh , Nav@@ j@@ oot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s primarily because scal@@ ability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
__zh-cn__ And remember that number : one billion .
__zh-cn__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__zh-cn__ Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
__zh-cn__ Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
__zh-cn__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__zh-cn__ This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ash@@ ram in Sev@@ ag@@ ram in India .
__zh-cn__ Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
__zh-cn__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__zh-cn__ We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
__zh-cn__ And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
__zh-cn__ What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Fol@@ d@@ sc@@ opes .
__zh-cn__ So what is a Fol@@ d@@ scope ?
__zh-cn__ A Fol@@ d@@ scope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , brigh@@ t-@@ field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__zh-cn__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
__zh-cn__ It starts with a single sheet of paper .
__zh-cn__ What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional brigh@@ t-@@ field and fluorescence microscope .
__zh-cn__ So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mas@@ k-@@ holding stage .
__zh-cn__ And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
__zh-cn__ What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
__zh-cn__ This paper has no instructions and no languages .
__zh-cn__ There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
__zh-cn__ When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the func@@ tion@@ alities of a standard microscope , just like an X@@ Y stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
__zh-cn__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__zh-cn__ So this is what changes , but the standard sta@@ ins all remain the same for many different diseases .
__zh-cn__ You pop this in .
__zh-cn__ There is an X@@ Y stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flex@@ ure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by mic@@ ron steps .
__zh-cn__ So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
__zh-cn__ I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stom@@ p on it .
__zh-cn__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__zh-cn__ Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ opes of different configurations all in a single folder .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
__zh-cn__ This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
__zh-cn__ So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
__zh-cn__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tups .
__zh-cn__ So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ opes are also projection microscopes .
__zh-cn__ I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
__zh-cn__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-@@ axis .
__zh-cn__ You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
__zh-cn__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens .
__zh-cn__ Right there .
__zh-cn__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__zh-cn__ So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dr@@ yer .
__zh-cn__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__zh-cn__ This also shows you how the projection scope works .
__zh-cn__ You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
__zh-cn__ Can we get the lights back on again ?
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was rol@@ l-@@ to-@@ roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call us@@ e-@@ and-@@ throw microscopy .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__zh-cn__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__zh-cn__ This is when we were thinking about the idea .
__zh-cn__ This is an A4 sheet of paper .
__zh-cn__ These are the three stages that you actually see .
__zh-cn__ And the optical components , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high through@@ puts , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build ach@@ rom@@ atic lenses in the paper itself .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
__zh-cn__ There are some light sources .
__zh-cn__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micr@@ on-@@ scale precision of optical alignment .
__zh-cn__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__zh-cn__ So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
__zh-cn__ There it is , and it survives .
__zh-cn__ So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
__zh-cn__ We are starting at the end of the summer .
__zh-cn__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__zh-cn__ That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Cha@@ gas disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves .
__zh-cn__ And I want to leave you with this picture .
__zh-cn__ I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
__zh-cn__ What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
__zh-cn__ I would love for them to be able to just print out a Fol@@ d@@ scope and carry them around in their pockets .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Our world has many superheroes .
__zh-cn__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__zh-cn__ For example , the cat@@ ado@@ res , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__zh-cn__ Cat@@ ado@@ res emerged from social inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system .
__zh-cn__ Cat@@ ado@@ res provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowledged for it .
__zh-cn__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__zh-cn__ Most of the cat@@ ado@@ res work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
__zh-cn__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
__zh-cn__ Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like graffiti and street art .
__zh-cn__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__zh-cn__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__zh-cn__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urban support for my message .
__zh-cn__ But at this time , giving voice to the cat@@ ado@@ res .
__zh-cn__ By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the cat@@ ado@@ res and improve their self-esteem .
__zh-cn__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__zh-cn__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__zh-cn__ I have painted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__zh-cn__ And then I realized that cat@@ ado@@ res , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__zh-cn__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__zh-cn__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__zh-cn__ And then , I created a collaborative movement called P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowd@@ funded event .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ So P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large crowd@@ funded event to help cat@@ ado@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
__zh-cn__ Cat@@ ado@@ res are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , po@@ di@@ at@@ rists , hair sty@@ lists , massage therapists and much more .
__zh-cn__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , rain@@ coats and eye@@ glasses to see in high-definition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are renov@@ ated by our incredible volunteers .
__zh-cn__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , hor@@ ns and mirrors .
__zh-cn__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__zh-cn__ P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Cur@@ itiba .
__zh-cn__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowd@@ funded edition of P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a .
__zh-cn__ So now everybody can join .
__zh-cn__ In two years , over 170 cat@@ ado@@ res , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
__zh-cn__ So cat@@ ado@@ res are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__zh-cn__ Because of their pim@@ ped car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__zh-cn__ So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the cat@@ ado@@ res and other invisible superheroes from your city .
__zh-cn__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__zh-cn__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ ado@@ res worldwide .
__zh-cn__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__zh-cn__ Mu@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Law@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of B@@ ing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ mapping effort .
__zh-cn__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__zh-cn__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__zh-cn__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the flu@@ idity of the zooming and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ gon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__zh-cn__ M@@ apping is , of course , not just about carto@@ graphy , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__zh-cn__ So , as we zo@@ om@@ -in beyond a certain level this re@@ solves into a kind of Si@@ m C@@ ity-@@ like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__zh-cn__ This can be viewed from any of the car@@ dinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ades .
__zh-cn__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__zh-cn__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__zh-cn__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__zh-cn__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-@@ local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__zh-cn__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__zh-cn__ These little green bubbles represent photosyn@@ ths that users have made .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosyn@@ ths are integrated into the map .
__zh-cn__ Everything that &apos;s cas@@ ed in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__zh-cn__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panor@@ am@@ ic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__zh-cn__ This takes Flickr , geo@@ registered imagery and uses photosyn@@ th@@ -like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__zh-cn__ So this one was taken around five .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__zh-cn__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-@@ sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carri@@ ages and so on as well .
__zh-cn__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it aug@@ menting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__zh-cn__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__zh-cn__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re inside the Pi@@ ke Place Market .
__zh-cn__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__zh-cn__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__zh-cn__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__zh-cn__ ( R@@ inging ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__zh-cn__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m pun@@ ching play .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__zh-cn__ So , these are our friends in Pi@@ ke Place Market , the lab .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__zh-cn__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__zh-cn__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__zh-cn__ No , no . The other way .
__zh-cn__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__zh-cn__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__zh-cn__ OK , never mind .
__zh-cn__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__zh-cn__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__zh-cn__ One of them is to take that real ...
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__zh-cn__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__zh-cn__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__zh-cn__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__zh-cn__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4@@ G network from the market .
__zh-cn__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__zh-cn__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dum@@ p@@ sters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__zh-cn__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__zh-cn__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__zh-cn__ So , this is an astronom@@ ically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__zh-cn__ All right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__zh-cn__ Thank you all very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__zh-cn__ And let me start with this .
__zh-cn__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urch@@ ins that like to eat the algae .
__zh-cn__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__zh-cn__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__zh-cn__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__zh-cn__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , man@@ ate@@ es , grou@@ pers , turtles , etc .
__zh-cn__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the green@@ ish part of the picture .
__zh-cn__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__zh-cn__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae over@@ growing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__zh-cn__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__zh-cn__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__zh-cn__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__zh-cn__ This sea is an arch@@ ip@@ el@@ ago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , un@@ fished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__zh-cn__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — over@@ grown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__zh-cn__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__zh-cn__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__zh-cn__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 17@@ 77 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the oars of their small boats while they were going ash@@ ore .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__zh-cn__ F@@ an@@ ning Island , 2,500 people .
__zh-cn__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__zh-cn__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__zh-cn__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Ke@@ ys National Marine S@@ anc@@ tuary .
__zh-cn__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__zh-cn__ If we go back to a place like Pal@@ my@@ ra At@@ oll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__zh-cn__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__zh-cn__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__zh-cn__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspic@@ uous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__zh-cn__ What have we learned from these places ?
__zh-cn__ This is what we thought was natural .
__zh-cn__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__zh-cn__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__zh-cn__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ vores , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that eat the algae .
__zh-cn__ Then the plankton feed@@ ers , these little dam@@ selfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__zh-cn__ And then we have a lower biomass of carni@@ vores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snap@@ pers , the large grou@@ pers .
__zh-cn__ But this is a consequence .
__zh-cn__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__zh-cn__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__zh-cn__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Reef , which is now protected .
__zh-cn__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__zh-cn__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__zh-cn__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snap@@ pers , more biomass of her@@ bi@@ vores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__zh-cn__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replen@@ ish .
__zh-cn__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant cl@@ ams ; pa@@ vements of giant cl@@ ams in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__zh-cn__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__zh-cn__ But still , now we have global warming .
__zh-cn__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__zh-cn__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__zh-cn__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__zh-cn__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals ble@@ ached and many died .
__zh-cn__ In Christmas , where the food web is really tri@@ m@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__zh-cn__ In F@@ an@@ ning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__zh-cn__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__zh-cn__ And the fish have gra@@ zed the algae , so the tur@@ f of algae is a little lower .
__zh-cn__ Then you go to Pal@@ my@@ ra At@@ oll that has more biomass of her@@ bi@@ vores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__zh-cn__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever ble@@ ach ?
__zh-cn__ These places ble@@ ached too , but they recovered faster .
__zh-cn__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__zh-cn__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__zh-cn__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__zh-cn__ Well , there are several ways .
__zh-cn__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-@@ take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__zh-cn__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__zh-cn__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__zh-cn__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__zh-cn__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__zh-cn__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__zh-cn__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__zh-cn__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urch@@ ins , and then the algae grow again .
__zh-cn__ So you have this little alg@@ al forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system reco@@ vers .
__zh-cn__ And this particular place , the Med@@ es Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__zh-cn__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__zh-cn__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-@@ take reserves do .
__zh-cn__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__zh-cn__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__zh-cn__ This is very substantial .
__zh-cn__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__zh-cn__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__zh-cn__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__zh-cn__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__zh-cn__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__zh-cn__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__zh-cn__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__zh-cn__ And same thing for in@@ vertebrates . This is the example .
__zh-cn__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__zh-cn__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__zh-cn__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__zh-cn__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__zh-cn__ This is in the Bahamas : N@@ assa@@ u grouper .
__zh-cn__ Huge abundance of grou@@ pers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__zh-cn__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__zh-cn__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__zh-cn__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__zh-cn__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a de@@ bit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__zh-cn__ Res@@ er@@ ves are like savings accounts .
__zh-cn__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__zh-cn__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__zh-cn__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__zh-cn__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-@@ for-@@ all .
__zh-cn__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , se@@ ine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__zh-cn__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__zh-cn__ But if we add the no-@@ take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__zh-cn__ Another example : N@@ assa@@ u grou@@ pers in Be@@ lize in the Mes@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ican Reef .
__zh-cn__ This is grouper sex , and the grou@@ pers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__zh-cn__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 grou@@ pers about this big in one hectare , in one aggre@@ gation .
__zh-cn__ Fish@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__zh-cn__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 grou@@ pers left .
__zh-cn__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__zh-cn__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__zh-cn__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__zh-cn__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__zh-cn__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__zh-cn__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__zh-cn__ So how much of this do we have ?
__zh-cn__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-@@ brain@@ er , how much of this do we have ?
__zh-cn__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Cha@@ gos Archi@@ pel@@ ago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__zh-cn__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__zh-cn__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__zh-cn__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__zh-cn__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__zh-cn__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__zh-cn__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__zh-cn__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__zh-cn__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__zh-cn__ So how can we do that ?
__zh-cn__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__zh-cn__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__zh-cn__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__zh-cn__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Cha@@ gos Archi@@ pel@@ ago .
__zh-cn__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__zh-cn__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__zh-cn__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__zh-cn__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__zh-cn__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__zh-cn__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__zh-cn__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__zh-cn__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__zh-cn__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__zh-cn__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-@@ take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the de@@ bit accounts with no deposits .
__zh-cn__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__zh-cn__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__zh-cn__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__zh-cn__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__zh-cn__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for comple@@ menting , not substitu@@ ting .
__zh-cn__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you En@@ ric .
__zh-cn__ En@@ ric Sal@@ a : Thank you .
__zh-cn__ CA : That was a master@@ ful job of pulling things together .
__zh-cn__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__zh-cn__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__zh-cn__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__zh-cn__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s basically it .
__zh-cn__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__zh-cn__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__zh-cn__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__zh-cn__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__zh-cn__ They are like cap@@ ac@@ itors of the system .
__zh-cn__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__zh-cn__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__zh-cn__ ES : At least in the seas .
__zh-cn__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Ser@@ enge@@ ti , with five lions per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est .
__zh-cn__ And on land , this cannot work .
__zh-cn__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__zh-cn__ We think this is universal .
__zh-cn__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__zh-cn__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__zh-cn__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__zh-cn__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__zh-cn__ ES : And then we have the under-@@ performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__zh-cn__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__zh-cn__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__zh-cn__ So thank you for those numbers .
__zh-cn__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__zh-cn__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__zh-cn__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__zh-cn__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__zh-cn__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__zh-cn__ But the best feeling is this biop@@ hilia that E.@@ O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of un@@ t@@ amed nature , of raw nature .
__zh-cn__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__zh-cn__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__zh-cn__ It would be just too depressing .
__zh-cn__ CA : Well , En@@ ric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ES : Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__zh-cn__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__zh-cn__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ thering me for 2,000 miles .
__zh-cn__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ My friend looks at me totally bl@@ ank@@ ly .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__zh-cn__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__zh-cn__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__zh-cn__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__zh-cn__ We get it in the abstract .
__zh-cn__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__zh-cn__ The human species , in general , is falli@@ ble — okay fine .
__zh-cn__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__zh-cn__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__zh-cn__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__zh-cn__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__zh-cn__ I think this is a problem .
__zh-cn__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__zh-cn__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__zh-cn__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__zh-cn__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__zh-cn__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__zh-cn__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__zh-cn__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__zh-cn__ D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ bs down .
__zh-cn__ Em@@ bar@@ r@@ assing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__zh-cn__ D@@ read@@ ful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__zh-cn__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Re@@ alizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__zh-cn__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revel@@ atory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__zh-cn__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__zh-cn__ Do you remember that Lo@@ ony T@@ unes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a road@@ runner ?
__zh-cn__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is chasing the road@@ runner and the road@@ runner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__zh-cn__ But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote runs off the cliff right after him .
__zh-cn__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s totally fine too .
__zh-cn__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-@@ air .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__zh-cn__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__zh-cn__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__zh-cn__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__zh-cn__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of ri@@ ghtness .
__zh-cn__ I call this error blindness .
__zh-cn__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__zh-cn__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__zh-cn__ This is not mine , by the way .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the trouble@@ maker , the one who never does his homework .
__zh-cn__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dim@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__zh-cn__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__zh-cn__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfec@@ tionists , over-@@ achi@@ evers .
__zh-cn__ Right , Mr. CF@@ O , astro@@ physicist , ultra-@@ marath@@ oner ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CF@@ O , astro@@ physicists , ultra-@@ marath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out .
__zh-cn__ Okay , so fine .
__zh-cn__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__zh-cn__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__zh-cn__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__zh-cn__ So let me tell you a story .
__zh-cn__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th Israel De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Medical Center for a surgery .
__zh-cn__ Be@@ th Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__zh-cn__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s anesthe@@ tized , the surgeon does his thing — stit@@ ches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__zh-cn__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__zh-cn__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in band@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in band@@ ages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__zh-cn__ When the vice president for health care quality at Be@@ th Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__zh-cn__ This internal sense of ri@@ ghtness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__zh-cn__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpe@@ doing the global economy .
__zh-cn__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__zh-cn__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__zh-cn__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__zh-cn__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__zh-cn__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resor@@ ting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__zh-cn__ The first thing we usually do when someone dis@@ agrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__zh-cn__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too mor@@ onic to put them together correctly .
__zh-cn__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent purposes .
__zh-cn__ So this is a catastrophe .
__zh-cn__ This attachment to our own ri@@ ghtness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__zh-cn__ But to me , what &apos;s most baff@@ ling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__zh-cn__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__zh-cn__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__zh-cn__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__zh-cn__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__zh-cn__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__zh-cn__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augu@@ stine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r therefore I am . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Augu@@ stine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__zh-cn__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__zh-cn__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__zh-cn__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__zh-cn__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__zh-cn__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__zh-cn__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrong@@ ness lady .
__zh-cn__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__zh-cn__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview I@@ ra Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__zh-cn__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__zh-cn__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same cryp@@ to-@@ theme .
__zh-cn__ And the cryp@@ to-@@ theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__zh-cn__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__zh-cn__ We love things like plot twists and red her@@ rings and surprise endings .
__zh-cn__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__zh-cn__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__zh-cn__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__zh-cn__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__zh-cn__ And something else happened instead .
__zh-cn__ And Hos@@ ni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the re@@ igns of power onto his son .
__zh-cn__ And something else happened instead .
__zh-cn__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__zh-cn__ And something else happened instead .
__zh-cn__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materi@@ alize .
__zh-cn__ And something else happened instead .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__zh-cn__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astoni@@ shes us .
__zh-cn__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__zh-cn__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__zh-cn__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-@@ altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__zh-cn__ We come up with another idea .
__zh-cn__ We tell another story .
__zh-cn__ We hold another conference .
__zh-cn__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ discovery of wonder .
__zh-cn__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of ri@@ ghtness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-@@ Say@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assass@@ inated Rabbi Me@@ ir Kah@@ ane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__zh-cn__ N@@ os@@ air was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synago@@ gues and the United Nations headquarters .
__zh-cn__ Thankfully , those plans were fo@@ iled by an FBI informant .
__zh-cn__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__zh-cn__ N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__zh-cn__ El-@@ Say@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
__zh-cn__ I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
__zh-cn__ It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
__zh-cn__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
__zh-cn__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__zh-cn__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__zh-cn__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__zh-cn__ We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton Sho@@ oting R@@ ange , which un@@ beknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
__zh-cn__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__zh-cn__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ uh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__zh-cn__ They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
__zh-cn__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__zh-cn__ Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
__zh-cn__ These were the men I looked up to .
__zh-cn__ These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means uncle .
__zh-cn__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__zh-cn__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__zh-cn__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bul@@ lies .
__zh-cn__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , ch@@ ubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__zh-cn__ So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
__zh-cn__ For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigot@@ ed household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__zh-cn__ So what opened my eyes ?
__zh-cn__ One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
__zh-cn__ My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
__zh-cn__ The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
__zh-cn__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Jewish .
__zh-cn__ Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ osity between the two of us .
__zh-cn__ I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
__zh-cn__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch Gard@@ ens , an amusement park .
__zh-cn__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__zh-cn__ As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kin@@ dest , least jud@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met .
__zh-cn__ Being bul@@ lied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very un@@ naturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__zh-cn__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acqu@@ ain@@ ted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
__zh-cn__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__zh-cn__ In@@ spiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
__zh-cn__ One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
__zh-cn__ She looked at me with the wear@@ y eyes of someone who had experienced enough dog@@ ma@@ tism to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
__zh-cn__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__zh-cn__ Z@@ ak E@@ brahim is not my real name .
__zh-cn__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__zh-cn__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__zh-cn__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__zh-cn__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__zh-cn__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ seless acts and condem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
__zh-cn__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__zh-cn__ I am not my father .
__zh-cn__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__zh-cn__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__zh-cn__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__zh-cn__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative transfer in non-@@ gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__zh-cn__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet K@@ GB , and stealing information and selling it .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__zh-cn__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s tedious .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__zh-cn__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__zh-cn__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__zh-cn__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon S@@ nake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__zh-cn__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__zh-cn__ My idea is : no ! No !
__zh-cn__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__zh-cn__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__zh-cn__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__zh-cn__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__zh-cn__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__zh-cn__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__zh-cn__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__zh-cn__ They know .
__zh-cn__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__zh-cn__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__zh-cn__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__zh-cn__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__zh-cn__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__zh-cn__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__zh-cn__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__zh-cn__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-si@@ ded things .
__zh-cn__ I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
__zh-cn__ Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us loops . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Kle@@ in bottles .
__zh-cn__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__zh-cn__ This is a Kle@@ in bottle .
__zh-cn__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__zh-cn__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-@@ ori@@ ent@@ able .
__zh-cn__ It has wonderful properties .
__zh-cn__ If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__zh-cn__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Kle@@ in bottles for the trade .
__zh-cn__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__zh-cn__ This is a Kle@@ in bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__zh-cn__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__zh-cn__ That was a month of my life .
__zh-cn__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__zh-cn__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__zh-cn__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__zh-cn__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__zh-cn__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__zh-cn__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at S@@ UN@@ Y Buff@@ alo . And wow !
__zh-cn__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__zh-cn__ And it sent me back .
__zh-cn__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__zh-cn__ This guy over here of course is me .
__zh-cn__ This man is Robert M@@ oo@@ g , the inventor of the M@@ oo@@ g synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__zh-cn__ Robert M@@ oo@@ g was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__zh-cn__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at S@@ UN@@ Y Buff@@ alo .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;d come up from Tr@@ um@@ ans@@ burg to teach me not just about the M@@ oo@@ g synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__zh-cn__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; M@@ ent@@ oring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__zh-cn__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__zh-cn__ In the background , my bicycle .
__zh-cn__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__zh-cn__ Bob M@@ oo@@ g came by and ha@@ uled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Fl@@ int and I things about this .
__zh-cn__ We sat around talking about F@@ ou@@ rier transforms , Bes@@ sel functions , mod@@ ulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__zh-cn__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__zh-cn__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert M@@ oo@@ g .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a tri@@ angular wave upon this Hew@@ let@@ t-@@ Packard oscill@@ oscope .
__zh-cn__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__zh-cn__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__zh-cn__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__zh-cn__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__zh-cn__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__zh-cn__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the y@@ ad@@ da y@@ ad@@ da .
__zh-cn__ I was talking about this stuff to some school@@ teachers about a year ago .
__zh-cn__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__zh-cn__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eigh@@ th-@@ grade science four days a week .
__zh-cn__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__zh-cn__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__zh-cn__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not cl@@ aps .
__zh-cn__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__zh-cn__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__zh-cn__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__zh-cn__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-@@ level physics .
__zh-cn__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__zh-cn__ You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
__zh-cn__ But you will need to know eigh@@ th-@@ grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__zh-cn__ None of this open-@@ to@@ -ch@@ ap@@ ter-@@ seven@@ -and-@@ do-@@ all-@@ the-@@ odd@@ -@@ problem-@@ sets .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__zh-cn__ ( High-@@ pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__zh-cn__ My students in El Cer@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscill@@ oscope — measured the speed of light .
__zh-cn__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__zh-cn__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__zh-cn__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__zh-cn__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__zh-cn__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__zh-cn__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__zh-cn__ But , probably — one of my students , Ari@@ el &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__zh-cn__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wa@@ vel@@ ength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__zh-cn__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__zh-cn__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__zh-cn__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eigh@@ th-@@ grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__zh-cn__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__zh-cn__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__zh-cn__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__zh-cn__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s 1.@@ 76 kilo@@ hertz . I measure its wavelength .
__zh-cn__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__zh-cn__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__zh-cn__ The s@@ lin@@ ky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__zh-cn__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__zh-cn__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__zh-cn__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__zh-cn__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. El@@ mo .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.@@ 76 kilo@@ hertz , or 17@@ 60 .
__zh-cn__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.@@ 76 times 0.2 over here is 3@@ 52 meters per second .
__zh-cn__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 43 .
__zh-cn__ But , here with klu@@ dgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__zh-cn__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__zh-cn__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__zh-cn__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Land@@ au , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ itz , Res@@ n@@ ick and Hal@@ li@@ day .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , El@@ mo &apos;s done : off .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m walking across campus . C@@ op comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__zh-cn__ P@@ ulls out a gun . G@@ oes boom !
__zh-cn__ And a tear gas can@@ ister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Who@@ osh !
__zh-cn__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__zh-cn__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__zh-cn__ He wants to cl@@ unk me over the head !
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hay@@ es Hall .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one of these bell@@ -@@ tower buildings .
__zh-cn__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__zh-cn__ Cha@@ sing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__zh-cn__ Cha@@ ses me into this room .
__zh-cn__ The en@@ tran@@ ce@@ way to the bell tower .
__zh-cn__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__zh-cn__ I go to a place where a do@@ wel splits off .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__zh-cn__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m thinking of Lor@@ en@@ z contractions and Ein@@ ste@@ inian relativity .
__zh-cn__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__zh-cn__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cup@@ ola .
__zh-cn__ A dome , one of these ten@@ -@@ foot domes .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bas@@ h@@ ing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__zh-cn__ Na@@ mely , that when they cast bells , they write inscri@@ ptions on them .
__zh-cn__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hay@@ es Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__zh-cn__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from nar@@ row@@ ness to broad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__zh-cn__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__zh-cn__ This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-@@ of-the-@@ night lock@@ smith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
__zh-cn__ Around the home , desig@@ nate a place for things that are easily lost .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__zh-cn__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__zh-cn__ If these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
__zh-cn__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__zh-cn__ Good morning !
__zh-cn__ Are you awake ?
__zh-cn__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__zh-cn__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__zh-cn__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__zh-cn__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunci@@ ation correct ?
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__zh-cn__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__zh-cn__ Two words made a Leban@@ ese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__zh-cn__ How could she speak that way ?
__zh-cn__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__zh-cn__ It made me mad .
__zh-cn__ It definitely hurts !
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__zh-cn__ Where could this happen ?
__zh-cn__ How did we get here ?
__zh-cn__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involun@@ tarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__zh-cn__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__zh-cn__ Chil@@ d@@ hood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__zh-cn__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to con@@ form ?
__zh-cn__ To be one of them ?
__zh-cn__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__zh-cn__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__zh-cn__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__zh-cn__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__zh-cn__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__zh-cn__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__zh-cn__ This is one reality .
__zh-cn__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__zh-cn__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__zh-cn__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__zh-cn__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequ@@ isite for creative expression in other languages .
__zh-cn__ How ?
__zh-cn__ Gi@@ br@@ an Khal@@ il Gi@@ br@@ an , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__zh-cn__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__zh-cn__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough bagg@@ age .
__zh-cn__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__zh-cn__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__zh-cn__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__zh-cn__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__zh-cn__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__zh-cn__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why they legis@@ late to protect their language .
__zh-cn__ They make it sacred .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__zh-cn__ Do we know better than them ?
__zh-cn__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__zh-cn__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__zh-cn__ They kept it close to them .
__zh-cn__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__zh-cn__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clu@@ eless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__zh-cn__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__zh-cn__ If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__zh-cn__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__zh-cn__ Language isn &apos;t just for con@@ vers@@ ing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__zh-cn__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and termin@@ ology that is linked to our emotions .
__zh-cn__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__zh-cn__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__zh-cn__ What is our intellect ?
__zh-cn__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__zh-cn__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ How would you feel ?
__zh-cn__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__zh-cn__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__zh-cn__ I have a franc@@ oph@@ one friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__zh-cn__ I asked her once how things were going .
__zh-cn__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__zh-cn__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__zh-cn__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__zh-cn__ &apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__zh-cn__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__zh-cn__ She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to F@@ air@@ u@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to F@@ air@@ u@@ z . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Trans@@ late that for me .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__zh-cn__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__zh-cn__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__zh-cn__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__zh-cn__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__zh-cn__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__zh-cn__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__zh-cn__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__zh-cn__ In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
__zh-cn__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__zh-cn__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__zh-cn__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__zh-cn__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__zh-cn__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__zh-cn__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__zh-cn__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__zh-cn__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__zh-cn__ Phot@@ os of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__zh-cn__ We are very cool !
__zh-cn__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__zh-cn__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__zh-cn__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__zh-cn__ Creativity is the idea .
__zh-cn__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__zh-cn__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__zh-cn__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__zh-cn__ A single novel could make us global again .
__zh-cn__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__zh-cn__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__zh-cn__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__zh-cn__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__zh-cn__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__zh-cn__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__zh-cn__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__zh-cn__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__zh-cn__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__zh-cn__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__zh-cn__ When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; Mer@@ ci , Mam@@ an , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cr@@ inge . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__zh-cn__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__zh-cn__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__zh-cn__ I want to know how I impact them .
__zh-cn__ I want to know how they impact me .
__zh-cn__ I want to know why they fish .
__zh-cn__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__zh-cn__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__zh-cn__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__zh-cn__ So what do we call this ?
__zh-cn__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__zh-cn__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replen@@ ish and progress .
__zh-cn__ Re@@ stor@@ ative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and ac@@ knowle@@ dges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replen@@ ish the ocean and to encourage its resili@@ ency .
__zh-cn__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__zh-cn__ Wal@@ let guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__zh-cn__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__zh-cn__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__zh-cn__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__zh-cn__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__zh-cn__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -c@@ au@@ ght yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__zh-cn__ Pole caught — no by@@ catch .
__zh-cn__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Sup@@ por@@ ting local economies .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__zh-cn__ Am I sitting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 16-@@ ounce portion of this ?
__zh-cn__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__zh-cn__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__zh-cn__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__zh-cn__ Ex@@ ample : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxid@@ ants and minerals — heart healthy .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__zh-cn__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__zh-cn__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__zh-cn__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__zh-cn__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__zh-cn__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waist@@ lines .
__zh-cn__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__zh-cn__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__zh-cn__ Re@@ stor@@ ative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by F@@ li@@ pper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the J@@ olly Green Giant .
__zh-cn__ Ve@@ ge@@ tables : they might yet save the oceans .
__zh-cn__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__zh-cn__ Well I &apos;d like to respec@@ t@@ fully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__zh-cn__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__zh-cn__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__zh-cn__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-@@ shell with a bottle of Tab@@ as@@ co and lemon we@@ dges .
__zh-cn__ It comes in a five-@@ ounce portion of til@@ ap@@ ia bread@@ ed with Di@@ j@@ on mustar@@ d and cri@@ spy , bro@@ iled bread@@ crumbs and a ste@@ aming pile of pec@@ an qu@@ ino@@ a pil@@ af with crun@@ chy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and char@@ red and smo@@ ky on the outside with just a hint of chil@@ i flake .
__zh-cn__ Wh@@ oo@@ o !
__zh-cn__ This is an easy sell .
__zh-cn__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__zh-cn__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__zh-cn__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__zh-cn__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__zh-cn__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
__zh-cn__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__zh-cn__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__zh-cn__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s start there .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__zh-cn__ Dan Bar@@ ber and Alice Wat@@ ers are leading passionately the green food De@@ li@@ cious Revolution .
__zh-cn__ But green foods often represent a way for us to dis@@ regard the responsibility as eaters .
__zh-cn__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with dis@@ regard on the plate .
__zh-cn__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__zh-cn__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__zh-cn__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-@@ you@@ -c@@ an-@@ eat shrimp buff@@ et .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__zh-cn__ Hear@@ t-@@ healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__zh-cn__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recomm@@ ending increased consumption of seafood .
__zh-cn__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__zh-cn__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__zh-cn__ A couple things happened .
__zh-cn__ I made more money .
__zh-cn__ People started buying appe@@ tiz@@ ers and sal@@ ads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entre@@ es alone .
__zh-cn__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__zh-cn__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__zh-cn__ They got more calories over the course of a diversi@@ fied meal .
__zh-cn__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__zh-cn__ This is great .
__zh-cn__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a he@@ aping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__zh-cn__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , ancho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ard@@ ines were uncommon .
__zh-cn__ Sh@@ ell@@ fish , mus@@ sels , oysters , cl@@ ams , til@@ ap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the common species .
__zh-cn__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__zh-cn__ This is what we need to favor .
__zh-cn__ This is what the green list says .
__zh-cn__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__zh-cn__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__zh-cn__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__zh-cn__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__zh-cn__ Start with a 16-@@ ounce portion of big fish .
__zh-cn__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__zh-cn__ Put it on four plates .
__zh-cn__ M@@ ound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Bur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__zh-cn__ Cele@@ brate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__zh-cn__ Inv@@ ite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__zh-cn__ I expect a lot from food .
__zh-cn__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__zh-cn__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the comm@@ union of human interests .
__zh-cn__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__zh-cn__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__zh-cn__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__zh-cn__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with cop@@ ious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__zh-cn__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__zh-cn__ I get sick when I go to ste@@ ak@@ houses .
__zh-cn__ I get the meat swe@@ ats .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from protein .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__zh-cn__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__zh-cn__ Eat your vegetables .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__zh-cn__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__zh-cn__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for whol@@ esome ingredients that are good for my body .
__zh-cn__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like pen@@ ance .
__zh-cn__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genu@@ fl@@ ect to my own personal histories .
__zh-cn__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__zh-cn__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__zh-cn__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the comm@@ union we call dinner .
__zh-cn__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__zh-cn__ We need to sav@@ or vegetables .
__zh-cn__ We need to sav@@ or smaller portions of seafood .
__zh-cn__ And we need to save dinner .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Hi . I am an architect .
__zh-cn__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__zh-cn__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fire@@ proof .
__zh-cn__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__zh-cn__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__zh-cn__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__zh-cn__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__zh-cn__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__zh-cn__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__zh-cn__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__zh-cn__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__zh-cn__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__zh-cn__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavi@@ lions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__zh-cn__ After , the building was recycled .
__zh-cn__ So that was the goal of my design .
__zh-cn__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in France in the city of Met@@ z .
__zh-cn__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__zh-cn__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 3@@ 5-@@ meter-@@ long office .
__zh-cn__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__zh-cn__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__zh-cn__ That was the problem .
__zh-cn__ Then I completed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Met@@ z .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__zh-cn__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__zh-cn__ They have money and power .
__zh-cn__ Those are invisible .
__zh-cn__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__zh-cn__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__zh-cn__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__zh-cn__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__zh-cn__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__zh-cn__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__zh-cn__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__zh-cn__ We can make it better .
__zh-cn__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__zh-cn__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__zh-cn__ Two tribes , Hut@@ u and Tut@@ si , fought each other .
__zh-cn__ Over two million people became refugees .
__zh-cn__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blan@@ kets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__zh-cn__ But over two million people cut trees .
__zh-cn__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__zh-cn__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum bar@@ racks .
__zh-cn__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__zh-cn__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__zh-cn__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the dur@@ ability and moisture and termites , so on .
__zh-cn__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__zh-cn__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nag@@ ata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__zh-cn__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__zh-cn__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__zh-cn__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__zh-cn__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__zh-cn__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__zh-cn__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__zh-cn__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ lish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__zh-cn__ I asked the Kir@@ in beer company to propose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ hi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__zh-cn__ The color coordination is very important .
__zh-cn__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__zh-cn__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__zh-cn__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__zh-cn__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__zh-cn__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we disman@@ tled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__zh-cn__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__zh-cn__ So this building became a permanent building .
__zh-cn__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__zh-cn__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__zh-cn__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__zh-cn__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__zh-cn__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__zh-cn__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sum@@ atra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__zh-cn__ And in 2008 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__zh-cn__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__zh-cn__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__zh-cn__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__zh-cn__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila , also they had a big earthquake .
__zh-cn__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__zh-cn__ And they are very kind , aff@@ ording my model .
__zh-cn__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__zh-cn__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__zh-cn__ Mr. Ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__zh-cn__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to San@@ to Domin@@ go , next-@@ door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in San@@ to Domin@@ go to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__zh-cn__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__zh-cn__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacu@@ ated in a big room like a gym@@ nas@@ ium .
__zh-cn__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__zh-cn__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__zh-cn__ So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__zh-cn__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-@@ story housing like this one .
__zh-cn__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__zh-cn__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making parti@@ tions .
__zh-cn__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in On@@ ag@@ awa village in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
__zh-cn__ He asked me to build three-@@ story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__zh-cn__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__zh-cn__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__zh-cn__ I was very happy to hear that .
__zh-cn__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christ@@ church .
__zh-cn__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christ@@ church , was totally destroyed .
__zh-cn__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__zh-cn__ So this is under construction .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , il@@ logical , ego@@ centric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__zh-cn__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely over@@ turned that picture .
__zh-cn__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__zh-cn__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__zh-cn__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__zh-cn__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__zh-cn__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__zh-cn__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__zh-cn__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__zh-cn__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__zh-cn__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness mono@@ logue about pon@@ ies and birth@@ days and things like that .
__zh-cn__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__zh-cn__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__zh-cn__ What we did — Betty Rap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bow@@ ls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious gold@@ fish cr@@ ackers .
__zh-cn__ Now all of the babies , even in Ber@@ k@@ ley , like the cr@@ ackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__zh-cn__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the cr@@ ackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__zh-cn__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ mmm , broccoli .
__zh-cn__ I tasted the broccoli . M@@ m@@ mmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , cr@@ ackers .
__zh-cn__ I tasted the cr@@ ackers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__zh-cn__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__zh-cn__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__zh-cn__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the cr@@ ackers if she liked the cr@@ ackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , 15 month-@@ olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__zh-cn__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__zh-cn__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__zh-cn__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__zh-cn__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__zh-cn__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-@@ olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-@@ olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__zh-cn__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__zh-cn__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__zh-cn__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__zh-cn__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superf@@ ici@@ ally , they seem pretty useless .
__zh-cn__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__zh-cn__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__zh-cn__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kangar@@ oos and wom@@ bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__zh-cn__ And sort of the poster@@ birds for this idea are the birds up there .
__zh-cn__ On one side is a New Cal@@ ed@@ onian crow .
__zh-cn__ And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ vens , ro@@ o@@ ks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__zh-cn__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__zh-cn__ And chickens and ducks and geese and tur@@ keys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__zh-cn__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pec@@ king for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__zh-cn__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Cal@@ ed@@ onian crow babies , are fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings .
__zh-cn__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__zh-cn__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__zh-cn__ So childhood is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__zh-cn__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__zh-cn__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__zh-cn__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pec@@ king grain in one environment .
__zh-cn__ Other creatures , like the cro@@ ws , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__zh-cn__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the cro@@ ws .
__zh-cn__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__zh-cn__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__zh-cn__ My son is 23 .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__zh-cn__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__zh-cn__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__zh-cn__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__zh-cn__ So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sling@@ shot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ You want to know all that before the mast@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
__zh-cn__ And the way the evolu@@ tions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__zh-cn__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__zh-cn__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__zh-cn__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__zh-cn__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__zh-cn__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__zh-cn__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like def@@ ective grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like cater@@ pillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the cater@@ pillars who are in@@ ching along our narrow , grow@@ n@@ up , adult path .
__zh-cn__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__zh-cn__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__zh-cn__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__zh-cn__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Thomas Bay@@ es , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__zh-cn__ And essentially what Bay@@ es did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__zh-cn__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__zh-cn__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__zh-cn__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__zh-cn__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__zh-cn__ And what Bay@@ es showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__zh-cn__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__zh-cn__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__zh-cn__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__zh-cn__ This is Re@@ ver@@ end Bay@@ es &apos;s notebook .
__zh-cn__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re re@@ vising to figure out how the world works .
__zh-cn__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__zh-cn__ Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__zh-cn__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__zh-cn__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ ket Det@@ ector .
__zh-cn__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__zh-cn__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__zh-cn__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tu@@ mar K@@ ush@@ ner , my student .
__zh-cn__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__zh-cn__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__zh-cn__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__zh-cn__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__zh-cn__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__zh-cn__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__zh-cn__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__zh-cn__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__zh-cn__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__zh-cn__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__zh-cn__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__zh-cn__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__zh-cn__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__zh-cn__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__zh-cn__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s one from Cri@@ stine Leg@@ are &apos;s lab .
__zh-cn__ What Cri@@ stine did was use our B@@ lic@@ ket Det@@ ectors .
__zh-cn__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__zh-cn__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__zh-cn__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__zh-cn__ Same as the other side .
__zh-cn__ Ali@@ son G@@ op@@ nik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__zh-cn__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__zh-cn__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__zh-cn__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__zh-cn__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__zh-cn__ Oh .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__zh-cn__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__zh-cn__ Not working either .
__zh-cn__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__zh-cn__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__zh-cn__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__zh-cn__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__zh-cn__ So when you put four .
__zh-cn__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__zh-cn__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__zh-cn__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cri@@ stine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__zh-cn__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__zh-cn__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__zh-cn__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__zh-cn__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__zh-cn__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__zh-cn__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__zh-cn__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__zh-cn__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__zh-cn__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__zh-cn__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__zh-cn__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__zh-cn__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shu@@ ts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__zh-cn__ So we have a very focused , purpos@@ e-@@ driven kind of attention .
__zh-cn__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__zh-cn__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__zh-cn__ So babies and young children are very bad at nar@@ rowing down to just one thing .
__zh-cn__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__zh-cn__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at induc@@ ing learning and plasticity , and the inhibit@@ ory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__zh-cn__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__zh-cn__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__zh-cn__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__zh-cn__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty me@@ et@@ ing-@@ attending zombie back home .
__zh-cn__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__zh-cn__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-@@ espres@@ so@@ s .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
__zh-cn__ We can do things like tie our sho@@ el@@ aces and cross the street by ourselves .
__zh-cn__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__zh-cn__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-@@ min@@ de@@ dness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaig@@ ner .
__zh-cn__ And this is the name of my campaign : S@@ IN@@ G Campaign .
__zh-cn__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46@@ 6@@ 64 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__zh-cn__ And 46@@ 6@@ 64 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Rob@@ b@@ en Island .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , onstage , having the time of my life .
__zh-cn__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Rob@@ b@@ en Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__zh-cn__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__zh-cn__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__zh-cn__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-@@ apartheid Rain@@ bow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__zh-cn__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__zh-cn__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Cap@@ e@@ town , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__zh-cn__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46@@ 6@@ 64 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__zh-cn__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone rever@@ es Nelson Mandela .
__zh-cn__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__zh-cn__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__zh-cn__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ kie Ach@@ mat , the founder of Tre@@ at@@ ment Action Campaign , an incredible campaig@@ ner and activist .
__zh-cn__ I met him at a 46@@ 6@@ 64 event .
__zh-cn__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__zh-cn__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__zh-cn__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Tre@@ at@@ ment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__zh-cn__ They work in the field .
__zh-cn__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__zh-cn__ They have education programs .
__zh-cn__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__zh-cn__ And yes , my S@@ IN@@ G Campaign has supported Tre@@ at@@ ment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__zh-cn__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Tre@@ at@@ ment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__zh-cn__ So this is my S@@ IN@@ G Campaign .
__zh-cn__ S@@ IN@@ G Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__zh-cn__ Here I am in O@@ slo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__zh-cn__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__zh-cn__ Aaron Mot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__zh-cn__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an en@@ vo@@ y for Scotland and HIV .
__zh-cn__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__zh-cn__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Mic@@ hel Si@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Mic@@ hel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__zh-cn__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broad@@ ening my outreach .
__zh-cn__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__zh-cn__ This can happen .
__zh-cn__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__zh-cn__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__zh-cn__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__zh-cn__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
__zh-cn__ This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wherever I go .
__zh-cn__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__zh-cn__ A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from A@@ ID@@ S-@@ related illness .
__zh-cn__ A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__zh-cn__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__zh-cn__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__zh-cn__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__zh-cn__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__zh-cn__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__zh-cn__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__zh-cn__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very reson@@ ant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__zh-cn__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__zh-cn__ This is the transformation that took place .
__zh-cn__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
__zh-cn__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__zh-cn__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__zh-cn__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__zh-cn__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__zh-cn__ The rocket was huge .
__zh-cn__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__zh-cn__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__zh-cn__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__zh-cn__ In the ol@@ den days , explorers like Vas@@ co da G@@ ama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__zh-cn__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__zh-cn__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__zh-cn__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__zh-cn__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__zh-cn__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__zh-cn__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__zh-cn__ All hell broke loose .
__zh-cn__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__zh-cn__ It provoked the missile gap .
__zh-cn__ It exploded an arms race .
__zh-cn__ It began the space race .
__zh-cn__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__zh-cn__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__zh-cn__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Dr@@ ill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__zh-cn__ Or the Gallup Pol@@ l that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__zh-cn__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__zh-cn__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__zh-cn__ Sup@@ port for engineering , math and science — education in general — bo@@ omed .
__zh-cn__ And V@@ int Cer@@ f points out that Sputnik led directly to AR@@ PA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__zh-cn__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stam@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
__zh-cn__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__zh-cn__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : long@@ time TEDster , Jay Walker .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) .
__zh-cn__ Thank you , Chris .
__zh-cn__ Today , a baff@@ led lady observed the shell where my soul d@@ wells And announced that I &apos;m &quot; articulate &quot; Which means that when it comes to en@@ unci@@ ation and dic@@ tion I don &apos;t even think of it ‘ Cause I ’ m &quot; &quot; articulate &quot; &quot; So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tain@@ ted with a connot@@ ation of urban@@ ized suggestion There ’ s no mis@@ directed intention P@@ ay attention ‘ Cause I ’ m “ articulate ” So when my father asks , “ Wh@@ a ’ kinda ting is dis ? ” My “ articulate ” answer never goes am@@ is@@ s I say “ father , this is the impending problem at hand ” And when I ’ m on the block I switch it up just because I can
__zh-cn__ So when my boy says , “ What ’ s good with you son ? ” I just say , “ I j@@ us ’ fall out wit dem people but I done ! ” And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “ Yo ! Why des@@ e books ne@@ va be about my peoples ” Yes , I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I ’ m “ articulate ” But who controls artic@@ ulation ?
__zh-cn__ Because the English language is a multi@@ fac@@ eted oration Sub@@ ject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I ’ m here to tell you that even “ articulate ” Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says , “ Hello ” I stop him and say “ N@@ oo@@ oo … You ’ re being in@@ articulate … the proper way is to say ‘ what ’ s good ’ ” Now you may think that ’ s too hood , that ’ s not cool But I ’ m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mom@@ my moc@@ ks me and says “ ya ’ l@@ l-@@ be@@ -@@ ma@@ dd@@ -@@ go@@ ing@@ -to-@@ the-@@ store ” I say “ Mom@@ my , no , that sentence is not following the law
__zh-cn__ Never does the word &quot; &quot; ma@@ dd &quot; &quot; go before a present partici@@ ple That ’ s simply the principle of this English ” If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop , From every suburbia , and every hood ‘ Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Gen@@ esis Of this world saying “ it is good &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with excell@@ ency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I ’ m too ignorant to teach ‘ Cause I speak three ton@@ gues One for each : Home , school and friends I ’ m a tri@@ -@@ lingu@@ al or@@ ator Sometimes I ’ m consistent with my language now
__zh-cn__ Then switch it up so I don ’ t bore later Sometimes I fight back two ton@@ gues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like … I ’ m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can ’ t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Euro@@ centric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history
__zh-cn__ I speak broken English so the prof@@ using g@@ ashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I ’ m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ’ ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I ’ m so sick of this non@@ sens@@ ical racial disparity So don ’ t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation
__zh-cn__ This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That ’ s why I put &quot; &quot; tri@@ -@@ lingu@@ al &quot; &quot; on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ’ ll be more than happy to show that I can say : “ What ’ s good ” “ What@@ ag@@ wan ” And of course … “ Hello ” Because I ’ m “ articulate ” Thank you .

__zh-cn__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__zh-cn__ As a cyber@@ -@@ magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__zh-cn__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__zh-cn__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber@@ -@@ illusi@@ onist .
__zh-cn__ Let me show you what I mean .
__zh-cn__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__zh-cn__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__zh-cn__ All right . Very significant mark .
__zh-cn__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Ac@@ qu@@ iring image .
__zh-cn__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__zh-cn__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__zh-cn__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter@@ .@@ MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__zh-cn__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__zh-cn__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lun@@ ar cycles .
__zh-cn__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__zh-cn__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__zh-cn__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__zh-cn__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__zh-cn__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__zh-cn__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__zh-cn__ Make a wish . ( B@@ lowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__zh-cn__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mis@@ chi@@ e@@ f-@@ makers . Watch .
__zh-cn__ Wake up .
__zh-cn__ Jo@@ ker : Who@@ a.@@ MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__zh-cn__ Jo@@ ker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__zh-cn__ Jo@@ ker : Pre@@ sen@@ ting my po@@ go stic@@ k@@ .@@ MT : Ah . Watch out .
__zh-cn__ Jo@@ ker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__zh-cn__ Voice : S@@ igned card detec@@ te@@ d.@@ MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9@@ -to-@@ 5 job ?
__zh-cn__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__zh-cn__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__zh-cn__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__zh-cn__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s ne@@ in ne@@ in . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__zh-cn__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__zh-cn__ The odds of getting it are 4,@@ 165 to one .
__zh-cn__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__zh-cn__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish@@ .@@ MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__zh-cn__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not@@ .@@ Voice : S@@ igned card detected .
__zh-cn__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__zh-cn__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__zh-cn__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__zh-cn__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__zh-cn__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__zh-cn__ I grew up in Bi@@ har , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious swee@@ ts at our doorstep .
__zh-cn__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__zh-cn__ He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-@@ eaten swee@@ ts was pulled away from us .
__zh-cn__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__zh-cn__ Those swee@@ ts were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__zh-cn__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bi@@ har , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__zh-cn__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bi@@ har was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__zh-cn__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__zh-cn__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was fami@@ shed and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scor@@ ching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and gr@@ aci@@ ously fed me .
__zh-cn__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__zh-cn__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__zh-cn__ I resolved to give back .
__zh-cn__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__zh-cn__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__zh-cn__ But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or rec@@ ourse .
__zh-cn__ It was Bi@@ har all over again .
__zh-cn__ Bi@@ har represents the challenge of development : ab@@ ject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__zh-cn__ Glob@@ ally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the B@@ ret@@ ton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__zh-cn__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__zh-cn__ Second , the development institutions that chann@@ eled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__zh-cn__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__zh-cn__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__zh-cn__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bi@@ har .
__zh-cn__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__zh-cn__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__zh-cn__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__zh-cn__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s O@@ port@@ uni@@ d@@ ades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__zh-cn__ This is the new ecosystem of open-@@ knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s O@@ port@@ uni@@ d@@ ades today inspiring New York City .
__zh-cn__ And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -to-@@ South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that chann@@ eled these transfers .
__zh-cn__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__zh-cn__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__zh-cn__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__zh-cn__ Take Ge@@ o@@ M@@ apping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-@@ school children .
__zh-cn__ So this simple mash@@ up reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-@@ school children , provo@@ king new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__zh-cn__ In this manner , the World Bank has now Ge@@ o@@ M@@ apped 30,000 project activities in 14@@ 3 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__zh-cn__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__zh-cn__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__zh-cn__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Haz@@ are movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__zh-cn__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__zh-cn__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__zh-cn__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__zh-cn__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__zh-cn__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__zh-cn__ In this map from Mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__zh-cn__ To@@ ols like this help turn a shelf full of in@@ scru@@ table documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__zh-cn__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ school@@ .org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bi@@ har .
__zh-cn__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school re@@ pairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swi@@ ft action .
__zh-cn__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Mol@@ do@@ va and beyond .
__zh-cn__ In D@@ ar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__zh-cn__ This is what the map of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__zh-cn__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__zh-cn__ Today , even Bi@@ har is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__zh-cn__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__zh-cn__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__zh-cn__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvan@@ ized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__zh-cn__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bi@@ har .
__zh-cn__ Two years ago , on April 8@@ th , 2010 , I called my father .
__zh-cn__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-@@ page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__zh-cn__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__zh-cn__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__zh-cn__ These became the two book@@ ends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mir@@ ro@@ red the changing development landscape .
__zh-cn__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__zh-cn__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__zh-cn__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__zh-cn__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bi@@ har , in Uganda , and beyond .
__zh-cn__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__zh-cn__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__zh-cn__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__zh-cn__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__zh-cn__ 6.@@ 6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__zh-cn__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__zh-cn__ Di@@ arr@@ hea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn &apos;t some smart , new technological innovations .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__zh-cn__ Wash@@ ing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
__zh-cn__ Hand@@ washing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , tr@@ ach@@ oma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is hand@@ washing with soap .
__zh-cn__ Hand@@ washing with soap keeps kids in school .
__zh-cn__ It stops babies from dying .
__zh-cn__ Hand@@ washing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__zh-cn__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__zh-cn__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__zh-cn__ So now just take a minute .
__zh-cn__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__zh-cn__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__zh-cn__ Please shake their hands .
__zh-cn__ All right , get to know each other .
__zh-cn__ They look really pretty .
__zh-cn__ All right .
__zh-cn__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__zh-cn__ Pretty y@@ ucky , you would agree with me .
__zh-cn__ Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
__zh-cn__ And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
__zh-cn__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__zh-cn__ Actually , soap is available .
__zh-cn__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__zh-cn__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__zh-cn__ So why is it ?
__zh-cn__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__zh-cn__ Why is it that May@@ ank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__zh-cn__ Well , in May@@ ank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__zh-cn__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cup@@ board .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__zh-cn__ On average , in May@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__zh-cn__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__zh-cn__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__zh-cn__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__zh-cn__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__zh-cn__ I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
__zh-cn__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__zh-cn__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__zh-cn__ Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ oy brand .
__zh-cn__ I@@ con@@ ic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about hand@@ washing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__zh-cn__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__zh-cn__ Think about it : Mar@@ ke@@ teers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__zh-cn__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__zh-cn__ Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as hand@@ washing with soap .
__zh-cn__ The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
__zh-cn__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ oy brand was launched in 18@@ 94 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__zh-cn__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__zh-cn__ A hundred and eigh@@ teen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__zh-cn__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__zh-cn__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__zh-cn__ The budget is not always there .
__zh-cn__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make hand@@ washing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__zh-cn__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting hand@@ washing with soap .
__zh-cn__ We have friends like USAID , the Global Pub@@ lic@@ -@@ Priv@@ ate Part@@ nership for Hand@@ washing with So@@ ap , London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and T@@ rop@@ ical Medicine , Plan , Water@@ Aid , that all believe for a win-@@ win-win partnership .
__zh-cn__ W@@ in for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__zh-cn__ W@@ in for the private sector , because we build new generations of future hand@@ wash@@ ers .
__zh-cn__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__zh-cn__ On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Hand@@ washing Day .
__zh-cn__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
__zh-cn__ If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message of hand@@ washing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
__zh-cn__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__zh-cn__ I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
__zh-cn__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__zh-cn__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__zh-cn__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__zh-cn__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doc@@ torate in hand@@ washing with soap .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__zh-cn__ We run today the world &apos;s largest hand@@ washing program by any public health standards .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve reached over 18@@ 3 million people in 16 countries .
__zh-cn__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__zh-cn__ Over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
__zh-cn__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equ@@ ated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__zh-cn__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__zh-cn__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__zh-cn__ This one is from My@@ an@@ mar .
__zh-cn__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__zh-cn__ Her son , My@@ o , is her second one .
__zh-cn__ She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks , and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant , and that if soap is used before touching the babies , we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equi@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__zh-cn__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__zh-cn__ I hope you will join us and make hand@@ washing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like My@@ o reach their fifth birthday .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , comb@@ s , glasses .
__zh-cn__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__zh-cn__ We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
__zh-cn__ The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
__zh-cn__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__zh-cn__ These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are ex@@ hum@@ ing bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
__zh-cn__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__zh-cn__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presum@@ ed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__zh-cn__ Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hos@@ ti@@ lities , when U.N. safe zones like S@@ re@@ br@@ en@@ ica fell into the hands of the Ser@@ b army .
__zh-cn__ The international criminal tri@@ bun@@ al delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__zh-cn__ Gen@@ oci@@ de is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__zh-cn__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__zh-cn__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__zh-cn__ Gen@@ oci@@ de is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__zh-cn__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__zh-cn__ There are always remnants of the peri@@ shed ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__zh-cn__ These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust .
__zh-cn__ Not a single body should remain un@@ discovered or uni@@ denti@@ fied .
__zh-cn__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalo@@ gu@@ ed and stored .
__zh-cn__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__zh-cn__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__zh-cn__ Sur@@ vi@@ vors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__zh-cn__ Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
__zh-cn__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shel@@ ved , out of sight and out of mind .
__zh-cn__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single ex@@ hum@@ ed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__zh-cn__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__zh-cn__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__zh-cn__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__zh-cn__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__zh-cn__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__zh-cn__ Once all the missing persons are identified , only dec@@ aying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain .
__zh-cn__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__zh-cn__ I am for chocolate don@@ uts .
__zh-cn__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-@@ day challenges .
__zh-cn__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__zh-cn__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-@@ day challenges .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s awful .
__zh-cn__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__zh-cn__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__zh-cn__ So the first work is called the Im@@ peri@@ al Mon@@ o@@ chrom@@ es .
__zh-cn__ A viewer sort of un@@ susp@@ ec@@ tingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__zh-cn__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__zh-cn__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__zh-cn__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__zh-cn__ This also reminded us of two very different pic@@ torial traditions .
__zh-cn__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Mal@@ evich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__zh-cn__ To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__zh-cn__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__zh-cn__ And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become la@@ x and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ gating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their pre@@ conditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a ty@@ rant .
__zh-cn__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Hand@@ held .
__zh-cn__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a let@@ ter-@@ sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__zh-cn__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__zh-cn__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the un@@ steady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__zh-cn__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__zh-cn__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__zh-cn__ And you immediately see how the un@@ steady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s a video .
__zh-cn__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__zh-cn__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-@@ eff@@ ac@@ ing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ stretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__zh-cn__ That sort of lik@@ ens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__zh-cn__ The next work is Dec@@ oy .
__zh-cn__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__zh-cn__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head@@ -like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__zh-cn__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of til@@ ts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__zh-cn__ So here is the first test scenario .
__zh-cn__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__zh-cn__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Dec@@ oy .
__zh-cn__ It appears to be mass-@@ manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__zh-cn__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of de@@ person@@ alizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__zh-cn__ And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
__zh-cn__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__zh-cn__ In the shape of an amphi@@ theater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__zh-cn__ So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
__zh-cn__ Se@@ ated in this audience are 9@@ 96 small figures .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__zh-cn__ This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
__zh-cn__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__zh-cn__ It could be a few cl@@ aps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
__zh-cn__ It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ aps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ov@@ ation .
__zh-cn__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of mus@@ ic@@ al-@@ like quality to it , an instrument .
__zh-cn__ So the viewer can play it by elic@@ iting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__zh-cn__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and cap@@ r@@ ici@@ ousness and un@@ eas@@ iness involved .
__zh-cn__ It also has an all@@ uring and tr@@ ap@@ -like quality to it .
__zh-cn__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of cl@@ ashing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the tension .
__zh-cn__ And here is a prototype .
__zh-cn__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engul@@ fed by 9@@ 96 of them .
__zh-cn__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Fra@@ mer@@ un@@ ners .
__zh-cn__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__zh-cn__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thick@@ nesses of wooden sections .
__zh-cn__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__zh-cn__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__zh-cn__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__zh-cn__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very com@@ ical and sl@@ ap@@ stic@@ k@@ -like quality , as if a puppe@@ teer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__zh-cn__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of ski@@ pping along like they &apos;re oblivious and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go-@@ lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__zh-cn__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__zh-cn__ These figures are sort of entr@@ apped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a for@@ tress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and care@@ free and quite oblivious of the external world .
__zh-cn__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with E@@ TH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__zh-cn__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-@@ bo@@ bbing movement and the back@@ -and-@@ forth movement .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__zh-cn__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__zh-cn__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of papers .
__zh-cn__ Now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
__zh-cn__ So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heavier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ And I would want to do that like that .
__zh-cn__ That would be the plan .
__zh-cn__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__zh-cn__ But then came my 9@@ 0-@@ page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
__zh-cn__ And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
__zh-cn__ It was way too big a project .
__zh-cn__ So I planned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
__zh-cn__ This is how the year would go .
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
__zh-cn__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__zh-cn__ No big deal , right ?
__zh-cn__ But then , the funni@@ est thing happened .
__zh-cn__ Those first few months ?
__zh-cn__ They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
__zh-cn__ So we had an awesome new re@@ vised plan .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
__zh-cn__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__zh-cn__ And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours , pulling not one but two all-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — humans are not supposed to pull two all-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — sprin@@ ted across campus , dove in slow motion , and got it in just at the deadline .
__zh-cn__ I thought that was the end of everything .
__zh-cn__ But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school .
__zh-cn__ And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Ur@@ ban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__zh-cn__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er-@@ blogger guy .
__zh-cn__ I write the blog Wait But Why .
__zh-cn__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procra@@ stination .
__zh-cn__ My behavior has always perplexed the non-@@ procrastin@@ ators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-@@ procrastin@@ ators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastin@@ ators , and why we are the way we are .
__zh-cn__ Now , I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastin@@ ators were actually different than the brains of other people .
__zh-cn__ And to test this , I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-@@ procrastin@@ ator , so I could compare them .
__zh-cn__ I actually brought them here to show you today .
__zh-cn__ I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
__zh-cn__ I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s the brain of a non-@@ procrastin@@ ator .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now ...
__zh-cn__ here &apos;s my brain .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) There is a difference .
__zh-cn__ Both brains have a R@@ ational Deci@@ sion@@ -@@ Maker in them , but the procrastin@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an In@@ stant Gra@@ tification Monkey .
__zh-cn__ Now , what does this mean for the procrastin@@ ator ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__zh-cn__ &#91; This is a perfect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; Nope ! &#93; So the R@@ ational Deci@@ sion@@ -@@ Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the Monkey doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the wheel , and he says , &quot; &quot; Actually , let &apos;s read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Ker@@ rigan / Tonya Har@@ ding scandal , because I just remembered that that happened .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go over to the fridge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago .
__zh-cn__ After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bi@@ eber &apos;s mom .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
__zh-cn__ Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Si@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?
__zh-cn__ The In@@ stant Gra@@ tification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
__zh-cn__ He lives entirely in the present moment .
__zh-cn__ He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only cares about two things : easy and fun .
__zh-cn__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
__zh-cn__ You have to keep well-@@ slept , well-@@ fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__zh-cn__ But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in tribal times .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Monkey does not know what that is .
__zh-cn__ Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational Deci@@ sion@@ -@@ Maker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
__zh-cn__ We can visualize the future .
__zh-cn__ We can see the big picture .
__zh-cn__ We can make long-term plans .
__zh-cn__ And he wants to take all of that into account .
__zh-cn__ And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
__zh-cn__ Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-@@ earned leisure time .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why there &apos;s an overlap .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes they agree .
__zh-cn__ But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__zh-cn__ And for the procrastin@@ ator , that conflict tends to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place that &apos;s entirely out of the Makes Sense circle .
__zh-cn__ I call it the Dark Play@@ ground .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Dark Play@@ ground is a place that all of you procrastin@@ ators out there know very well .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
__zh-cn__ The fun you have in the Dark Play@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely un@@ earned , and the air is filled with guilt , dread , anxiety , self-@@ hatred — all of those good procrastin@@ ator feelings .
__zh-cn__ And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastin@@ ator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
__zh-cn__ Well , turns out the procrastin@@ ator has a guar@@ dian angel , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments — someone called the Pan@@ ic Monster .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Pan@@ ic Monster is dormant most of the time , but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there &apos;s danger of public embarrassment , a career disaster or some other scary consequence .
__zh-cn__ And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of .
__zh-cn__ Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this excitement , the R@@ ational Deci@@ sion@@ -@@ Maker seemed to have something else on his mind .
__zh-cn__ He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accepted ?
__zh-cn__ Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
__zh-cn__ We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the Monkey said , &quot; &quot; Totally agree , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India , like 200 feet above the ground , and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__zh-cn__ And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
__zh-cn__ And guess who woke up ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So the Pan@@ ic Monster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in may@@ hem . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ And the Monkey — remember , he &apos;s terrified of the Pan@@ ic Monster — boom , he &apos;s up the tree !
__zh-cn__ And finally , finally , the R@@ ational Deci@@ sion@@ -@@ Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk .
__zh-cn__ Now , the Pan@@ ic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastin@@ ator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then mirac@@ ulously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
__zh-cn__ And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastin@@ ator &apos;s system .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__zh-cn__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__zh-cn__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__zh-cn__ Literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
__zh-cn__ These are people who were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
__zh-cn__ But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heav@@ iness of these emails .
__zh-cn__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procra@@ stination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__zh-cn__ And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the procrastin@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
__zh-cn__ Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of procra@@ stination .
__zh-cn__ Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , the examples I &apos;ve given , they all have dead@@ lines .
__zh-cn__ And when there &apos;s dead@@ lines , the effects of procra@@ stination are contained to the short term because the Pan@@ ic Monster gets involved .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s a second kind of procra@@ stination that happens in situations when there is no deadline .
__zh-cn__ So if you wanted a career where you &apos;re a self-@@ starter — something in the arts , something entrepreneurial — there &apos;s no dead@@ lines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get momentum , get things going .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don &apos;t involve any dead@@ lines , like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health , working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn &apos;t working .
__zh-cn__ Now if the procrastin@@ ator &apos;s only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Pan@@ ic Monster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non-@@ deadline situations , the Pan@@ ic Monster doesn &apos;t show up .
__zh-cn__ He has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of procra@@ stination , they &apos;re not contained ; they just extend outward forever .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s this long-term kind of procra@@ stination that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the funni@@ er , short-term dead@@ lin@@ e-based kind .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s usually suffered quietly and privately .
__zh-cn__ And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness , and regrets .
__zh-cn__ And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cram@@ ming for some project .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s that long-term procra@@ stination has made them feel like a spect@@ ator , at times , in their own lives .
__zh-cn__ The frustration is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start chasing them .
__zh-cn__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-@@ procrastin@@ ators exist .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastin@@ ators .
__zh-cn__ Now , you might not all be a mess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with dead@@ lines , but remember : the Monkey &apos;s snea@@ ki@@ est trick is when the dead@@ lines aren &apos;t there .
__zh-cn__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__zh-cn__ I call this a Life Cal@@ end@@ ar .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s not that many boxes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
__zh-cn__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__zh-cn__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__zh-cn__ We need to stay aware of the In@@ stant Gra@@ tification Monkey .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__zh-cn__ And because there &apos;s not that many boxes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
__zh-cn__ Well , maybe not today , but ...
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__zh-cn__ Some@@ time soon .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Sw@@ en@@ son who recently was awarded the congressional Med@@ al of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__zh-cn__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__zh-cn__ The column came under am@@ bush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Sw@@ en@@ son was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__zh-cn__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a com@@ rade were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ ac helicopter .
__zh-cn__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the me@@ dev@@ ac medic@@ s happened to have a Go@@ Pro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__zh-cn__ It shows Captain Sw@@ en@@ son and his com@@ rade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gun@@ shot to the neck .
__zh-cn__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Sw@@ en@@ son bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__zh-cn__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__zh-cn__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
__zh-cn__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__zh-cn__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__zh-cn__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__zh-cn__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__zh-cn__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why they &apos;re attracted to the military .
__zh-cn__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__zh-cn__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__zh-cn__ What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__zh-cn__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__zh-cn__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__zh-cn__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__zh-cn__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__zh-cn__ I can &apos;t simply instruc@@ t two people to cooperate , and they will .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__zh-cn__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__zh-cn__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Pale@@ olithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__zh-cn__ Nothing personal .
__zh-cn__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a sab@@ er-@@ tooth@@ ed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__zh-cn__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__zh-cn__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__zh-cn__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__zh-cn__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__zh-cn__ If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for danger .
__zh-cn__ Bad system of survival .
__zh-cn__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__zh-cn__ The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustr@@ ate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
__zh-cn__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__zh-cn__ It could be a new technology that r@@ enders your business model obsolete overnight .
__zh-cn__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustr@@ ate your growth and steal your business from you .
__zh-cn__ We have no control over these forces .
__zh-cn__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__zh-cn__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__zh-cn__ When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comfor@@ ts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
__zh-cn__ I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
__zh-cn__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__zh-cn__ So I said something .
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__zh-cn__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__zh-cn__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__zh-cn__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__zh-cn__ The reason we like flying Sou@@ thwest Air@@ lines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__zh-cn__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to exp@@ end our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weak@@ ens the organization .
__zh-cn__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__zh-cn__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__zh-cn__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__zh-cn__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__zh-cn__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__zh-cn__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__zh-cn__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next J@@ ump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__zh-cn__ We would never do it .
__zh-cn__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__zh-cn__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__zh-cn__ If you get a job at Next J@@ ump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__zh-cn__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__zh-cn__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__zh-cn__ They have violated this deep-@@ seated social contract .
__zh-cn__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__zh-cn__ This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers .
__zh-cn__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__zh-cn__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Ter@@ esa ?
__zh-cn__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__zh-cn__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__zh-cn__ the people to save the numbers .
__zh-cn__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__zh-cn__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called B@@ arr@@ y-@@ We@@ h@@ mill@@ er , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__zh-cn__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__zh-cn__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed lay@@ offs .
__zh-cn__ And Bob refused .
__zh-cn__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__zh-cn__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__zh-cn__ And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
__zh-cn__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of un@@ paid vacation .
__zh-cn__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ secu@@ tively .
__zh-cn__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__zh-cn__ He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and mor@@ ale went up .
__zh-cn__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__zh-cn__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__zh-cn__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__zh-cn__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__zh-cn__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__zh-cn__ I know many people at the sen@@ ior@@ most levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__zh-cn__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__zh-cn__ And I know many people who are at the bottom@@ s of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__zh-cn__ This is what a leader is .
__zh-cn__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__zh-cn__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__zh-cn__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__zh-cn__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__zh-cn__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__zh-cn__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__zh-cn__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__zh-cn__ Thank you very much .
__zh-cn__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Ki@@ pling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
__zh-cn__ The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
__zh-cn__ At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
__zh-cn__ If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
__zh-cn__ To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
__zh-cn__ One night , my friend Mal@@ te , were camping in the Amazon region .
__zh-cn__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green av@@ oc@@ a@@ do branch .
__zh-cn__ Then came a moment of inspiration .
__zh-cn__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__zh-cn__ A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
__zh-cn__ The coil then closes the hole .
__zh-cn__ The search started again .
__zh-cn__ We went back to the drawing board .
__zh-cn__ Doctors have only to close the cathe@@ ter through the hole .
__zh-cn__ No open surgery was necessary .
__zh-cn__ We lost the fear of creating something new .
__zh-cn__ The path , it &apos;s not easy .
__zh-cn__ Many obstacles arise all the time .
__zh-cn__ But we receive strength from our patients .
__zh-cn__ We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
__zh-cn__ We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
__zh-cn__ Mu@@ ch@@ as gr@@ aci@@ as .
__zh-cn__ So I grew up in L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , on the border of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o and M@@ pum@@ al@@ anga , a little town called Mot@@ et@@ ema .
__zh-cn__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sun@@ bathing .
__zh-cn__ The L@@ imp@@ op@@ o sun gets really hot in winter .
__zh-cn__ So as we were sun@@ bathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__zh-cn__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__zh-cn__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__zh-cn__ V@@ arious diseases thrive in this environment , the most dr@@ astic of which is called tr@@ ach@@ oma .
__zh-cn__ Tr@@ ach@@ oma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multi@@ ple infections of tr@@ ach@@ oma can leave you permanently blind .
__zh-cn__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with tr@@ ach@@ oma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injec@@ tions .
__zh-cn__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ sty little ste@@ ed , my No@@ kia 6@@ 234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-@@ r@@ and-@@ an-@@ hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ ams , the compositions , the melting points , the tox@@ icities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__zh-cn__ and it looked like the K@@ FC special sp@@ ice , you know ?
__zh-cn__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__zh-cn__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__zh-cn__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-@@ page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest pat@@ ent-@@ holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented Dr@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first bath@@ -@@ substitu@@ ting lo@@ tion .
__zh-cn__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__zh-cn__ So we learned a few lessons in commerci@@ alizing and making Dr@@ y@@ B@@ ath available .
__zh-cn__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__zh-cn__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__zh-cn__ So we packaged Dr@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innovative little sac@@ he@@ ts .
__zh-cn__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__zh-cn__ And the cool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et substitu@@ tes one bath for five r@@ and .
__zh-cn__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__zh-cn__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want Dr@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__zh-cn__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they ski@@ pped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__zh-cn__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was clean@@ liness and convenience .
__zh-cn__ Dr@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lif@@ es@@ aver .
__zh-cn__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , with an allow@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__zh-cn__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that ac@@ col@@ ade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause . )
__zh-cn__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__zh-cn__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__zh-cn__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__zh-cn__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cos@@ t@@ -c@@ utting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , dis@@ engaged , or had dist@@ anced themselves from hospital management .
__zh-cn__ So with this focus on cos@@ t@@ -c@@ utting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__zh-cn__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__zh-cn__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__zh-cn__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__zh-cn__ In other countries , new drugs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__zh-cn__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__zh-cn__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__zh-cn__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__zh-cn__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__zh-cn__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__zh-cn__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__zh-cn__ At B@@ CG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__zh-cn__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__zh-cn__ We call this value-@@ based healthcare .
__zh-cn__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__zh-cn__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Por@@ ter and Elizabeth Te@@ is@@ berg .
__zh-cn__ On this picture , you have my fa@@ ther-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__zh-cn__ When we started doing our research at B@@ CG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__zh-cn__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__zh-cn__ The differences were dramatic .
__zh-cn__ Erik , my fa@@ ther-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__zh-cn__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-@@ repu@@ ted healthcare system .
__zh-cn__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming in@@ continent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__zh-cn__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__zh-cn__ If he instead would go to Ham@@ burg , and to a clinic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i-@@ K@@ l@@ ini@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__zh-cn__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-@@ fold difference .
__zh-cn__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__zh-cn__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__zh-cn__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__zh-cn__ Nobody knows .
__zh-cn__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__zh-cn__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__zh-cn__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__zh-cn__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__zh-cn__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__zh-cn__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__zh-cn__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And they finally agreed .
__zh-cn__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__zh-cn__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-@@ operated on in their lifetime .
__zh-cn__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__zh-cn__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__zh-cn__ Since then , they publish every year .
__zh-cn__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__zh-cn__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__zh-cn__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__zh-cn__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__zh-cn__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__zh-cn__ Contin@@ uous improvement .
__zh-cn__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__zh-cn__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__zh-cn__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__zh-cn__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-@@ operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__zh-cn__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__zh-cn__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__zh-cn__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__zh-cn__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__zh-cn__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__zh-cn__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__zh-cn__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__zh-cn__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__zh-cn__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__zh-cn__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__zh-cn__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__zh-cn__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__zh-cn__ Phys@@ icians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__zh-cn__ They were always best in class .
__zh-cn__ We were always best in class .
__zh-cn__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__zh-cn__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__zh-cn__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__zh-cn__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discus@@ ses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__zh-cn__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__zh-cn__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__zh-cn__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__zh-cn__ This is happening in reality .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__zh-cn__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Por@@ ter at Harvard Business School , and the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute in Sweden , B@@ CG has formed something we call I@@ CH@@ O@@ M .
__zh-cn__ You may think that &apos;s a snee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a snee@@ ze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__zh-cn__ It stands for the International Con@@ sortium for Health Out@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ rement .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : catar@@ acts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__zh-cn__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__zh-cn__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__zh-cn__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__zh-cn__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__zh-cn__ Why is that ?
__zh-cn__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__zh-cn__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__zh-cn__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__zh-cn__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__zh-cn__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__zh-cn__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__zh-cn__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__zh-cn__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__zh-cn__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__zh-cn__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__zh-cn__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , cl@@ enched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__zh-cn__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__zh-cn__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippo@@ crates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Is it just right ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d done well at school . Ex@@ pec@@ tations for me were high , and I gle@@ efully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__zh-cn__ Under@@ neath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emp@@ tiness that I felt was within me .
__zh-cn__ I was leaving a semin@@ ar when it started , humming to myself , fum@@ bling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice cal@@ mly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__zh-cn__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and deci@@ siveness of the comment was un@@ mista@@ kable .
__zh-cn__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__zh-cn__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__zh-cn__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , nar@@ rating everything I did in the third person .
__zh-cn__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__zh-cn__ It was neutral , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , strangely compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ expressed emotion .
__zh-cn__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at conce@@ aling how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__zh-cn__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__zh-cn__ I spent some time telling the college G.@@ P.
__zh-cn__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange comment@@ ator .
__zh-cn__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bul@@ let@@ ins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__zh-cn__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly over@@ take me .
__zh-cn__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tor@@ menting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__zh-cn__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__zh-cn__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and men@@ ac@@ ing .
__zh-cn__ You see that glass of water ?
__zh-cn__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__zh-cn__ Two years later , and the deterior@@ ation was dramatic .
__zh-cn__ By now , I had the whole fr@@ enz@@ ied repertoire : terrifying voices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__zh-cn__ Now looking back on the w@@ reck@@ age and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__zh-cn__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__zh-cn__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__zh-cn__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes , you know , it sno@@ ws as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agon@@ ized , lonely place .
__zh-cn__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__zh-cn__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__zh-cn__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__zh-cn__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__zh-cn__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Str@@ ate@@ gic .
__zh-cn__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organizational body of the International H@@ earing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Mari@@ us Rom@@ me and Dr. Sand@@ ra E@@ sch@@ er , which loc@@ ates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an ab@@ err@@ ant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__zh-cn__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__zh-cn__ To paraphrase Cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__zh-cn__ You cannot humili@@ ate the person who feels pride .
__zh-cn__ You cannot op@@ press the people who are not afraid anymore .
__zh-cn__ In the last 20 years , the H@@ earing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an un@@ sha@@ kable belief in the power of the individual .
__zh-cn__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endo@@ wed with an instinc@@ tual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__zh-cn__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facil@@ itating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__zh-cn__ We are unique . We are ir@@ replac@@ eable .
__zh-cn__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , cont@@ or@@ ted , or taken away .
__zh-cn__ The light never goes out .
__zh-cn__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__zh-cn__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__zh-cn__ Or is it photography ?
__zh-cn__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__zh-cn__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__zh-cn__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__zh-cn__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__zh-cn__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__zh-cn__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__zh-cn__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__zh-cn__ Phot@@ os like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__zh-cn__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__zh-cn__ And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of realism .
__zh-cn__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__zh-cn__ When I say realism , I mean photo-@@ realism .
__zh-cn__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__zh-cn__ Phot@@ os where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__zh-cn__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__zh-cn__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__zh-cn__ Is it something about the light ?
__zh-cn__ What creates the illusion ?
__zh-cn__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__zh-cn__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__zh-cn__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__zh-cn__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__zh-cn__ And let me show you a simple example .
__zh-cn__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__zh-cn__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__zh-cn__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__zh-cn__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__zh-cn__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__zh-cn__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__zh-cn__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__zh-cn__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__zh-cn__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__zh-cn__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__zh-cn__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__zh-cn__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__zh-cn__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__zh-cn__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__zh-cn__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__zh-cn__ So here &apos;s another example .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__zh-cn__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__zh-cn__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__zh-cn__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__zh-cn__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__zh-cn__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__zh-cn__ The shores are from a different location .
__zh-cn__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__zh-cn__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__zh-cn__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__zh-cn__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__zh-cn__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__zh-cn__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__zh-cn__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__zh-cn__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we want an anonymous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the emails , you get to see the exchanges of messages , you get to see the mechanics of how this works , how this operates .
__zh-cn__ Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
__zh-cn__ The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bas@@ har Al-@@ As@@ sad has also got offshore companies .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s been alleg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ list .
__zh-cn__ And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
__zh-cn__ Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thr@@ iller or a John G@@ ris@@ ham novel .
__zh-cn__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__zh-cn__ Why should we care about this ?
__zh-cn__ But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
__zh-cn__ And that affects all of us .
__zh-cn__ Now , for my organization Global Witness , this expos@@ é has been phenomenal .
__zh-cn__ We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
__zh-cn__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baff@@ ling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__zh-cn__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__zh-cn__ So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
__zh-cn__ It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
__zh-cn__ I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less coverage of this issue in the United States .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this expos@@ é , in this scandal .
__zh-cn__ Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are st@@ ashing their assets offshore .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mos@@ sack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fewer American clients .
__zh-cn__ I think if we saw leaks from the C@@ ay@@ man Islands or even from Delaware or Wy@@ oming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__zh-cn__ In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
__zh-cn__ That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school@@ children .
__zh-cn__ It has allowed scam@@ mers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__zh-cn__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__zh-cn__ Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
__zh-cn__ How does this actually work ?
__zh-cn__ So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms .
__zh-cn__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__zh-cn__ Now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .
__zh-cn__ These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
__zh-cn__ This is not just about an individual lawyer who &apos;s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal .
__zh-cn__ This is about how a system works , that entr@@ en@@ ches corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
__zh-cn__ And in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
__zh-cn__ We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder .
__zh-cn__ This may seem like doom and gloom , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be rich and powerful individuals .
__zh-cn__ But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
__zh-cn__ Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
__zh-cn__ This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
__zh-cn__ And since then , the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe .
__zh-cn__ One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is l@@ agging behind .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s bi@@ partisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate , but it isn &apos;t making as much progress as we &apos;d like to see .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__zh-cn__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__zh-cn__ We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
__zh-cn__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Sec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;
__zh-cn__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__zh-cn__ Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax ev@@ asion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
__zh-cn__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been reported that Wiki@@ Le@@ aks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__zh-cn__ Can that possibly be true ?
__zh-cn__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__zh-cn__ CA : How does it work ?
__zh-cn__ How do people release the documents ?
__zh-cn__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__zh-cn__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__zh-cn__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__zh-cn__ We get information in the mail , the regular pos@@ tal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__zh-cn__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__zh-cn__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__zh-cn__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__zh-cn__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__zh-cn__ If we can have this document up ...
__zh-cn__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__zh-cn__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__zh-cn__ JA : So this is the K@@ roll Report .
__zh-cn__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__zh-cn__ Pri@@ or to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel ar@@ ap Mo@@ i for about 18 years .
__zh-cn__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__zh-cn__ And when Ki@@ ba@@ ki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__zh-cn__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Mo@@ i , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__zh-cn__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__zh-cn__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Ki@@ ba@@ ki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel ar@@ ap Mo@@ i , so this report then became a dead al@@ batross around President Ki@@ ba@@ ki &apos;s neck .
__zh-cn__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__zh-cn__ And so it came in from the outside .
__zh-cn__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__zh-cn__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__zh-cn__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yep .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad air@@ strike video .
__zh-cn__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__zh-cn__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__zh-cn__ Radio : ... just f@@ uck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__zh-cn__ I see your element , uh , got about four Hum@@ ve@@ es , uh , out along ...
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Fir@@ ing .
__zh-cn__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__zh-cn__ Light &apos; em all up .
__zh-cn__ C &apos;@@ mon , fire !
__zh-cn__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__zh-cn__ Hotel ... B@@ ush@@ master Two-@@ Six , B@@ ush@@ master Two-@@ Six ,
__zh-cn__ we need to move , time now !
__zh-cn__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__zh-cn__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__zh-cn__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__zh-cn__ Two-@@ Six , this is Two-@@ Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__zh-cn__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__zh-cn__ God damn it , K@@ yle . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I hit &apos; em .
__zh-cn__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__zh-cn__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__zh-cn__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__zh-cn__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__zh-cn__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reu@@ ters employees ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah . Two Reu@@ ters employees , two young children were wounded .
__zh-cn__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__zh-cn__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__zh-cn__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__zh-cn__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__zh-cn__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-@@ millimeter can@@ non shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__zh-cn__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurg@@ ents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__zh-cn__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Man@@ ning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 2@@ 80,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__zh-cn__ I mean , did he ?
__zh-cn__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__zh-cn__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__zh-cn__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Rey@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__zh-cn__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__zh-cn__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__zh-cn__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-@@ rights abuses in those governments .
__zh-cn__ If you look at decl@@ assi@@ fied cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__zh-cn__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__zh-cn__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__zh-cn__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__zh-cn__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into conce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conce@@ al it .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__zh-cn__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__zh-cn__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__zh-cn__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__zh-cn__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-@@ motivated .
__zh-cn__ CA : So they are well-@@ motivated .
__zh-cn__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__zh-cn__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__zh-cn__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are in@@ human people .
__zh-cn__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__zh-cn__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__zh-cn__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__zh-cn__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__zh-cn__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__zh-cn__ Light is good .
__zh-cn__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wiki@@ Le@@ aks dissidents yet .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__zh-cn__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__zh-cn__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__zh-cn__ You know , there might be a couple of views of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks and of Julian .
__zh-cn__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__zh-cn__ D@@ ang@@ erous trouble@@ maker .
__zh-cn__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__zh-cn__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous trouble@@ maker view ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__zh-cn__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__zh-cn__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__zh-cn__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__zh-cn__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__zh-cn__ What is this ?
__zh-cn__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__zh-cn__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blow@@ outs in Alban@@ ia , like the well blow@@ out in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__zh-cn__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__zh-cn__ And part of the Alban@@ ian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__zh-cn__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__zh-cn__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__zh-cn__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__zh-cn__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__zh-cn__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__zh-cn__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__zh-cn__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__zh-cn__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__zh-cn__ Yeah .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__zh-cn__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of veri@@ fying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__zh-cn__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__zh-cn__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minim@@ ized while we &apos;re re-@@ engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a problem .
__zh-cn__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower dis@@ closures of a very high cali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__zh-cn__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journ@@ alistic volunteers and / or the funding of journ@@ alistic salaries ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__zh-cn__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__zh-cn__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__zh-cn__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__zh-cn__ Can that be right ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__zh-cn__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__zh-cn__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__zh-cn__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__zh-cn__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__zh-cn__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__zh-cn__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__zh-cn__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__zh-cn__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__zh-cn__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__zh-cn__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__zh-cn__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__zh-cn__ CA : Cap@@ able , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__zh-cn__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__zh-cn__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__zh-cn__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was inj@@ unc@@ ted from running the story .
__zh-cn__ Instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
__zh-cn__ That made you very high-@@ profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__zh-cn__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__zh-cn__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__zh-cn__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__zh-cn__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__zh-cn__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__zh-cn__ And the national TV station was inj@@ unc@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : inj@@ unc@@ tion landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a fill@@ er , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__zh-cn__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journ@@ alistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__zh-cn__ Iceland &apos;s a Nor@@ dic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__zh-cn__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__zh-cn__ CA : Wow .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__zh-cn__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exer@@ ting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__zh-cn__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__zh-cn__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmon@@ ize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__zh-cn__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__zh-cn__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__zh-cn__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
__zh-cn__ And it was the journey of my life .
__zh-cn__ It was amazing .
__zh-cn__ The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
__zh-cn__ I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
__zh-cn__ It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
__zh-cn__ And I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
__zh-cn__ But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
__zh-cn__ I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
__zh-cn__ What we see , we can be .
__zh-cn__ So screw fear and challenges .
__zh-cn__ We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
__zh-cn__ Second one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or joy .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Hall@@ a T@@ ó@@ mas@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
__zh-cn__ Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have visited more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth .
__zh-cn__ And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
__zh-cn__ So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equi@@ voc@@ ation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll mention to begin with .
__zh-cn__ First of all is the mis@@ interpretation of religious scriptures , holy scriptures , in the Bible , Old Test@@ ament , New Test@@ ament , Quran and so forth , and these have been mis@@ interpreted by men who are now in the asc@@ end@@ ant positions in the synago@@ gues and the churches and in the mosques .
__zh-cn__ And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily releg@@ ated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
__zh-cn__ A number of years ago , in the year 2000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ tist , a Southern B@@ ap@@ tist for 70 years — I tell you , I still teach Sunday school every Sunday ; I &apos;ll be teaching this Sunday as well — but the Southern B@@ ap@@ tist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent position to men .
__zh-cn__ So they issued an e@@ dict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pa@@ stors , de@@ acons in the church , or chap@@ la@@ ins in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern B@@ ap@@ tist semin@@ ary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the Bible , there &apos;s over 30,000 verses in the Bible , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth .
__zh-cn__ But the basic thing is the scriptures are mis@@ interpreted to keep men in an asc@@ end@@ ant position .
__zh-cn__ That is an all-@@ pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why should I treat them as equals myself ?
__zh-cn__ Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work ?
__zh-cn__ The other very serious b@@ light that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
__zh-cn__ In the United States of America , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison .
__zh-cn__ When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
__zh-cn__ Nowadays , 7.@@ 3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s a seven@@ fold increase .
__zh-cn__ And since I left the White House , there &apos;s been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison .
__zh-cn__ We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
__zh-cn__ And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re in California now , and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convic@@ ting 13 people for the death penalty .
__zh-cn__ If you add that up , that &apos;s 30@@ 7 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed .
__zh-cn__ Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
__zh-cn__ One is genital mutilation .
__zh-cn__ Gen@@ ital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her genit@@ als are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a raz@@ or blade and , in a non-@@ steri@@ lized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s genit@@ alia .
__zh-cn__ And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or menstr@@ u@@ ate .
__zh-cn__ And then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have sex .
__zh-cn__ This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
__zh-cn__ In Egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
__zh-cn__ In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity .
__zh-cn__ This is a horrible afflic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
__zh-cn__ Another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with mis@@ interpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there &apos;s nothing in the Quran that mand@@ ates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing .
__zh-cn__ An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetr@@ ated by the father , the uncle or the brother , but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women .
__zh-cn__ Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery , or human trafficking it &apos;s called nowadays .
__zh-cn__ There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
__zh-cn__ There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
__zh-cn__ The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery .
__zh-cn__ In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bon@@ d@@ age , or slavery .
__zh-cn__ Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Em@@ ory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
__zh-cn__ Atlanta has the bus@@ iest airport in the world , and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere .
__zh-cn__ If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
__zh-cn__ A white-@@ skin@@ ned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
__zh-cn__ The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia .
__zh-cn__ So this is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ ore@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local officials , the local policemen , or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth .
__zh-cn__ And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world .
__zh-cn__ Sweden has got a good approach to it .
__zh-cn__ In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
__zh-cn__ For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
__zh-cn__ Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
__zh-cn__ We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
__zh-cn__ In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assa@@ ults take place .
__zh-cn__ The last report I got , there were 2@@ 6,000 sexual assa@@ ults that took place in the military — 2@@ 6,000 .
__zh-cn__ Only 3,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine , or a battal@@ ion in the Army or a company in the Marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosec@@ ute a rap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command , sexual assa@@ ults are taking place , so they do not do it .
__zh-cn__ That law needs to be changed .
__zh-cn__ The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rap@@ ists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they &apos;ll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re not prosecuted .
__zh-cn__ Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
__zh-cn__ When I became president , the difference was 39 percent .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
__zh-cn__ These are the kind of things that go on .
__zh-cn__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__zh-cn__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__zh-cn__ I will not dance to that beating .
__zh-cn__ I know that beat .
__zh-cn__ It is lifel@@ ess .
__zh-cn__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__zh-cn__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__zh-cn__ I will not dance to your drum@@ me@@ d-up war .
__zh-cn__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__zh-cn__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__zh-cn__ I will not kill for you .
__zh-cn__ Especially I will not die for you .
__zh-cn__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__zh-cn__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__zh-cn__ Everyone can be wrong .
__zh-cn__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__zh-cn__ I will not forget where I come from .
__zh-cn__ I will craft my own drum .
__zh-cn__ G@@ ather my beloved near , and our chan@@ ting will be dancing .
__zh-cn__ Our humming will be drum@@ ming .
__zh-cn__ I will not be played .
__zh-cn__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__zh-cn__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__zh-cn__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__zh-cn__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Ha@@ aa .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) A bunch of paci@@ fists .
__zh-cn__ Con@@ fused , aspiring paci@@ fists .
__zh-cn__ I understand .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__zh-cn__ Like a lot .
__zh-cn__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__zh-cn__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been pre@@ pping .
__zh-cn__ What that means is pre@@ pping my outfit , ( Laughter ) pre@@ pping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__zh-cn__ Poetry does that .
__zh-cn__ It pre@@ ps you . It aims you .
__zh-cn__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__zh-cn__ Hold her now with you .
__zh-cn__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__zh-cn__ Are you holding her ?
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clu@@ stered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__zh-cn__ Un@@ written books predicted the future , projected the past .
__zh-cn__ But my head un@@ wraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__zh-cn__ Wh@@ ose son shall it be ?
__zh-cn__ Which male child will per@@ ish a new day ?
__zh-cn__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvan@@ ize .
__zh-cn__ We cherish cor@@ p@@ ses .
__zh-cn__ We mourn women , complicated .
__zh-cn__ Bit@@ ches get beat daily .
__zh-cn__ Pro@@ fits made , prophets ignored .
__zh-cn__ War and tooth , en@@ am@@ eled sal@@ ted lemon child@@ hoods .
__zh-cn__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__zh-cn__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__zh-cn__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__zh-cn__ R@@ hyth@@ m is half silence .
__zh-cn__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__zh-cn__ S@@ ick@@ ness , health , tender violence .
__zh-cn__ I think now I never was pure .
__zh-cn__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;@@ ant — still am .
__zh-cn__ Human contrac@@ ted itself blind , malignant .
__zh-cn__ I never was pure .
__zh-cn__ Girl spo@@ iled before ri@@ pen@@ ed .
__zh-cn__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__zh-cn__ I experience exponentially .
__zh-cn__ Everything is everything .
__zh-cn__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__zh-cn__ One woman loses six .
__zh-cn__ One woman loses her head .
__zh-cn__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__zh-cn__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__zh-cn__ One woman straps herself .
__zh-cn__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__zh-cn__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__zh-cn__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__zh-cn__ One woman never did .
__zh-cn__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__zh-cn__ Bro@@ ken , dis@@ sed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__zh-cn__ Fac@@ ed with absence .
__zh-cn__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .

__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__zh-cn__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__zh-cn__ Global famine was inevitable .
__zh-cn__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
__zh-cn__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__zh-cn__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__zh-cn__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__zh-cn__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per@@ -cap@@ ita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__zh-cn__ Li@@ f@@ esp@@ an is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__zh-cn__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__zh-cn__ Per@@ -cap@@ ita food production is up by a third .
__zh-cn__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__zh-cn__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__zh-cn__ How did we achieve that ?
__zh-cn__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more pop@@ ulous ?
__zh-cn__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__zh-cn__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and re@@ combine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__zh-cn__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__zh-cn__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__zh-cn__ These are both real objects .
__zh-cn__ One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ lean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__zh-cn__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__zh-cn__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__zh-cn__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ varying design for about a million years — from one-@@ and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__zh-cn__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__zh-cn__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__zh-cn__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__zh-cn__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__zh-cn__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__zh-cn__ The object on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__zh-cn__ And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__zh-cn__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve come together .
__zh-cn__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__zh-cn__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__zh-cn__ In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__zh-cn__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__zh-cn__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different line@@ ages .
__zh-cn__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__zh-cn__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__zh-cn__ No other animal does it .
__zh-cn__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s recipro@@ city in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__zh-cn__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__zh-cn__ You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture .
__zh-cn__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__zh-cn__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__zh-cn__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__zh-cn__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__zh-cn__ Chimpanz@@ ee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__zh-cn__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__zh-cn__ Well , the answer came from David Ric@@ ardo in 18@@ 17 .
__zh-cn__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__zh-cn__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__zh-cn__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__zh-cn__ So Oz is better at both spe@@ ars and axes than Adam .
__zh-cn__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__zh-cn__ He can make his own spe@@ ars and axes .
__zh-cn__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spe@@ ars and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__zh-cn__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spe@@ ars .
__zh-cn__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__zh-cn__ And this is one of the beau@@ ties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__zh-cn__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__zh-cn__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__zh-cn__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__zh-cn__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__zh-cn__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__zh-cn__ You render it down . You make a candle , et@@ c. etc .
__zh-cn__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__zh-cn__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__zh-cn__ And the answer is about half a second .
__zh-cn__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__zh-cn__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__zh-cn__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__zh-cn__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__zh-cn__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__zh-cn__ It was self-@@ suffici@@ ency .
__zh-cn__ We call that poverty these days .
__zh-cn__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__zh-cn__ How many other people ?
__zh-cn__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__zh-cn__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__zh-cn__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__zh-cn__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__zh-cn__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__zh-cn__ Louis X@@ IV had a lot of people working for him .
__zh-cn__ They made his silly out@@ fits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hair@@ styles , or whatever .
__zh-cn__ He had 4@@ 98 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__zh-cn__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Ver@@ sa@@ illes and looking at Louis X@@ IV &apos;s pictures , he has 4@@ 98 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re in bi@@ stro@@ s and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis X@@ IV even had .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__zh-cn__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__zh-cn__ An@@ ts are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__zh-cn__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__zh-cn__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__zh-cn__ The queen does it all .
__zh-cn__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__zh-cn__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__zh-cn__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__zh-cn__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__zh-cn__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__zh-cn__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__zh-cn__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__zh-cn__ The woman knows that , in the Had@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__zh-cn__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a war@@ tho@@ g .
__zh-cn__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__zh-cn__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a war@@ tho@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__zh-cn__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__zh-cn__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__zh-cn__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__zh-cn__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__zh-cn__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__zh-cn__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__zh-cn__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOX@@ P2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__zh-cn__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__zh-cn__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Neanderthals .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__zh-cn__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__zh-cn__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__zh-cn__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ ert .
__zh-cn__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ ert , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ dian from a long way away .
__zh-cn__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__zh-cn__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__zh-cn__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__zh-cn__ Ex@@ change between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__zh-cn__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ dian and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__zh-cn__ You also see seash@@ ells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__zh-cn__ And that will have led to specialization .
__zh-cn__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__zh-cn__ Well , you look at modern hunter gather@@ ers like abor@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who quar@@ ried for stone axes at a place called Mount Is@@ a , which was a quarry owned by the Kal@@ k@@ ado@@ on tribe .
__zh-cn__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stin@@ gray bar@@ bs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__zh-cn__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__zh-cn__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__zh-cn__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__zh-cn__ An example is Tasmania .
__zh-cn__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced re@@ gress .
__zh-cn__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a desert island .
__zh-cn__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__zh-cn__ It didn &apos;t happen in Ti@@ erra del Fu@@ ego — similar island , similar people .
__zh-cn__ The reason : because Ti@@ erra del Fu@@ ego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__zh-cn__ The Tas@@ mani@@ ans were isolated .
__zh-cn__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__zh-cn__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__zh-cn__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__zh-cn__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__zh-cn__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__zh-cn__ I mean this quite seriously .
__zh-cn__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__zh-cn__ He just knows how to run a company .
__zh-cn__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__zh-cn__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__zh-cn__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pen@@ cil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__zh-cn__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__zh-cn__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__zh-cn__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__zh-cn__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other groups .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__zh-cn__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__zh-cn__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__zh-cn__ However , bad things happen .
__zh-cn__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__zh-cn__ There will be wars ; there will be depres@@ sions ; there will be natural disasters .
__zh-cn__ Aw@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__zh-cn__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Good afternoon .
__zh-cn__ My name is Ul@@ dus .
__zh-cn__ I am a photo-@@ based artist from Russia .
__zh-cn__ I started my way around six years ago with ironic self-@@ portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nation@@ alities , gen@@ ders , and social issues — &#91; &quot; &quot; I am Russian . I sell drugs , guns , por@@ no with kids ! &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; V@@ od@@ ka = water . I love vodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using photography as my tool to send a message . &#91; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ry me , I need a vis@@ a . &quot; &quot; &#93; Today , I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Won@@ der Woman .
__zh-cn__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__zh-cn__ Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named Des@@ per@@ ate Rom@@ an@@ tics .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re my artifacts , or paintings from pre-@@ Rap@@ ha@@ elites Brotherhood England mid-@@ 19th century .
__zh-cn__ I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-@@ models but have an interesting story .
__zh-cn__ This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm tro@@ oper has no personality .
__zh-cn__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__zh-cn__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphor@@ ic .
__zh-cn__ And this is Ni@@ kit@@ a , a security guard from one of the bars in St. Peter@@ sburg .
__zh-cn__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__zh-cn__ He hides his sensi@@ ti@@ vities and romantic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be romantic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive h@@ ul@@ k .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
__zh-cn__ Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ir@@ oning man .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__zh-cn__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
__zh-cn__ And what about me ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__zh-cn__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__zh-cn__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__zh-cn__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__zh-cn__ Be funny and create some magic .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ My name is A@@ mit .
__zh-cn__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__zh-cn__ And it took 18 months .
__zh-cn__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__zh-cn__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__zh-cn__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__zh-cn__ And I grew up in India .
__zh-cn__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__zh-cn__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__zh-cn__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__zh-cn__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__zh-cn__ So , simple : you come to Google@@ Ar@@ t@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ .com.
__zh-cn__ You look around at all these museums here .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the Van Gogh .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__zh-cn__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__zh-cn__ Clic@@ k and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__zh-cn__ You move around , you have fun .
__zh-cn__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__zh-cn__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__zh-cn__ Keep going . Have fun .
__zh-cn__ Expl@@ ore .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Har@@ vest@@ ers &quot; &quot; by Pi@@ eter Bru@@ egel at the Met .
__zh-cn__ I see this plus sign .
__zh-cn__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__zh-cn__ Now this is one of the images .
__zh-cn__ So this is all of the meta-@@ data information .
__zh-cn__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__zh-cn__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gig@@ api@@ x@@ el technology .
__zh-cn__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__zh-cn__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__zh-cn__ You can zoom around very simply .
__zh-cn__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__zh-cn__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__zh-cn__ But then you really want to go deep .
__zh-cn__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__zh-cn__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__zh-cn__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tuesday .
__zh-cn__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__zh-cn__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__zh-cn__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__zh-cn__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__zh-cn__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__zh-cn__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Star@@ ry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__zh-cn__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__zh-cn__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__zh-cn__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; The Star@@ ry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__zh-cn__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Coll@@ ections .
__zh-cn__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__zh-cn__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__zh-cn__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Z@@ oom — you can just zoom around .
__zh-cn__ This is &quot; &quot; The Am@@ bassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__zh-cn__ You can ann@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__zh-cn__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__zh-cn__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__zh-cn__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__zh-cn__ It really comes from these artists .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__zh-cn__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__zh-cn__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni .
__zh-cn__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glim@@ p@@ ses of my personal story .
__zh-cn__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geome@@ trical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__zh-cn__ I was born in Str@@ as@@ bour@@ g , France to Turkish parents .
__zh-cn__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__zh-cn__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__zh-cn__ Now in the early 1970s , in An@@ k@@ ara , that was a bit unusual .
__zh-cn__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divor@@ ce@@ e in a patriarchal environment .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of woman@@ hood .
__zh-cn__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , we@@ ster@@ n@@ ized , Turkish woman .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__zh-cn__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to f@@ end off the evil eye .
__zh-cn__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or war@@ ts on their hands .
__zh-cn__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thor@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to remove .
__zh-cn__ Then one by one , she would enc@@ ir@@ cle these thor@@ ns with dark ink .
__zh-cn__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or un@@ healed .
__zh-cn__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__zh-cn__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also be@@ ware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a ble@@ m@@ ish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__zh-cn__ It will dry up inside .
__zh-cn__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__zh-cn__ We all do .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__zh-cn__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__zh-cn__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we stay for too long inside our cultural coco@@ ons .
__zh-cn__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__zh-cn__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with vel@@ vet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__zh-cn__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like@@ -minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__zh-cn__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnos@@ tics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__zh-cn__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__zh-cn__ In my opinion , one way of transc@@ ending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__zh-cn__ Stories cannot demo@@ lish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__zh-cn__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__zh-cn__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__zh-cn__ My mother came home one day with a tur@@ quo@@ ise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__zh-cn__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my san@@ ity .
__zh-cn__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__zh-cn__ I was an intro@@ verted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologi@@ zing to objects when I bum@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__zh-cn__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__zh-cn__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__zh-cn__ And thus began my life-@@ long passion for writing fiction .
__zh-cn__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcend@@ ental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__zh-cn__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__zh-cn__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__zh-cn__ My mother became a diplomat .
__zh-cn__ So from this small , supersti@@ tious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this pos@@ h , international school &#91; in Mad@@ rid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__zh-cn__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative fore@@ igner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nation@@ alities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmop@@ olitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__zh-cn__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__zh-cn__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__zh-cn__ The child who represented it was moc@@ ked , ridic@@ uled and bul@@ lied endlessly .
__zh-cn__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military take@@ over happened in my country , a gun@@ man of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision Song Con@@ test .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I ski@@ pped school often and dreamed of becoming a sail@@ or during those days .
__zh-cn__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__zh-cn__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Ex@@ press , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inqui@@ red how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Tur@@ ks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__zh-cn__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__zh-cn__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and An@@ k@@ ara again .
__zh-cn__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__zh-cn__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__zh-cn__ In my mid-@@ twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__zh-cn__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__zh-cn__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__zh-cn__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__zh-cn__ There was the local gro@@ cer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to margin@@ als .
__zh-cn__ He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wig and mas@@ car@@ a running down her cheeks .
__zh-cn__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trem@@ bling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative gro@@ cer and a crying trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te smoking together on the sidewalk .
__zh-cn__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__zh-cn__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__zh-cn__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__zh-cn__ I started writing fiction in English .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__zh-cn__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__zh-cn__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__zh-cn__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__zh-cn__ When you &apos;re a lat@@ ec@@ omer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__zh-cn__ As lat@@ ec@@ omers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__zh-cn__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__zh-cn__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__zh-cn__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__zh-cn__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I ur@@ gently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__zh-cn__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__zh-cn__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__zh-cn__ I guess one part of me has always been a nom@@ ad , physically and spirit@@ ually .
__zh-cn__ Stories ac@@ company me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__zh-cn__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__zh-cn__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__zh-cn__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__zh-cn__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__zh-cn__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__zh-cn__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__zh-cn__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__zh-cn__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__zh-cn__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circul@@ ated , read and reviewed .
__zh-cn__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-@@ Western authors feel it more heavily .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;re expected to write informa@@ tive , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and av@@ ant-@@ garde to your Western colleagues .
__zh-cn__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Mad@@ rid is happening in the literary world today .
__zh-cn__ Writ@@ ers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__zh-cn__ The writer and commu@@ ter James Bal@@ d@@ win gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__zh-cn__ When the inter@@ viewer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole him as a gay writer , Bal@@ d@@ win stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lum@@ ped together .
__zh-cn__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__zh-cn__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indon@@ esian — like a joke , you know .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__zh-cn__ It was only because of our passports .
__zh-cn__ Mul@@ tic@@ ultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__zh-cn__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__zh-cn__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__zh-cn__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__zh-cn__ It comes from everywhere .
__zh-cn__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters ut@@ tered in a novel .
__zh-cn__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-@@ layered novel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__zh-cn__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__zh-cn__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Tur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian conflict .
__zh-cn__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__zh-cn__ It was just a story .
__zh-cn__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to bel@@ ittle my work .
__zh-cn__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__zh-cn__ Writ@@ ers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__zh-cn__ Chek@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__zh-cn__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; I@@ denti@@ ty politics divides us . F@@ ic@@ tion connects .
__zh-cn__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__zh-cn__ The other , in nu@@ ances .
__zh-cn__ One draws boundaries .
__zh-cn__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__zh-cn__ I@@ denti@@ ty politics is made of solid bricks .
__zh-cn__ F@@ ic@@ tion is flowing water .
__zh-cn__ In the Ottoman times , there were it@@ iner@@ ant storytellers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__zh-cn__ With each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his voice , imperson@@ ating that character .
__zh-cn__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sul@@ tan , Muslims and non-@@ Muslims .
__zh-cn__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ ales of N@@ as@@ re@@ ddin H@@ od@@ ja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__zh-cn__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__zh-cn__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empath@@ izing with the narrator .
__zh-cn__ Liter@@ ature has to take us beyond .
__zh-cn__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__zh-cn__ Books have saved the intro@@ verted , tim@@ id child that I was — that I once was .
__zh-cn__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ izing them .
__zh-cn__ When the poet and mystic , Rum@@ i , met his spiritual companion , Sha@@ ms of Tab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rum@@ i &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__zh-cn__ The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ tist , distant and disconnected .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__zh-cn__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__zh-cn__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__zh-cn__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__zh-cn__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__zh-cn__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__zh-cn__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ api Pal@@ ace , which was the residence of Ottoman sul@@ tans for more than 400 years .
__zh-cn__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The Ga@@ thering Place of the D@@ j@@ inn .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__zh-cn__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__zh-cn__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the d@@ j@@ inn , who are made of smo@@ k@@ eless fire and are the symbol of el@@ usi@@ veness .
__zh-cn__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__zh-cn__ When I write fiction I cherish el@@ usi@@ veness and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
__zh-cn__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__zh-cn__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__zh-cn__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__zh-cn__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__zh-cn__ Au@@ d@@ re Lor@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__zh-cn__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__zh-cn__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__zh-cn__ Imag@@ in@@ ative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__zh-cn__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__zh-cn__ We should get out of our cultural ghet@@ to and go visit the next one and the next .
__zh-cn__ In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ shes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__zh-cn__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__zh-cn__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m Jane McG@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
__zh-cn__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__zh-cn__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.@@ 93 million years solving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ oth .
__zh-cn__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hear@@ ty species .
__zh-cn__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__zh-cn__ Five million people use it every month .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__zh-cn__ His work is brilliant .
__zh-cn__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__zh-cn__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__zh-cn__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuck@@ les .
__zh-cn__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__zh-cn__ This is really exciting .
__zh-cn__ According to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__zh-cn__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__zh-cn__ We made this game in 2007 .
__zh-cn__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ veling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resource@@ fulness .
__zh-cn__ The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Roc@@ kies .
__zh-cn__ And the job in question was sheep ran@@ cher .
__zh-cn__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__zh-cn__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__zh-cn__ The job in question : her@@ ding sheep . Great .
__zh-cn__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that ca@@ stration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__zh-cn__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__zh-cn__ But , this is a tou@@ chy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__zh-cn__ So I called the Hum@@ ane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__zh-cn__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__zh-cn__ And then another band is applied to the scrot@@ um , tightly .
__zh-cn__ Blood flow is slowly retar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__zh-cn__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__zh-cn__ OK , I call the SP@@ CA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__zh-cn__ I also call PE@@ TA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__zh-cn__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__zh-cn__ So the next day I go out .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lam@@ bs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
__zh-cn__ Mel@@ anie is the wife of Albert .
__zh-cn__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__zh-cn__ Mel@@ anie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__zh-cn__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__zh-cn__ Alright . Great .
__zh-cn__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__zh-cn__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__zh-cn__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__zh-cn__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__zh-cn__ And he kind of flic@@ ked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Roc@@ kies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__zh-cn__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__zh-cn__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ finger , he had the scrot@@ um firmly in his grasp .
__zh-cn__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__zh-cn__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__zh-cn__ He sni@@ ps it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrot@@ um and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obsc@@ uring my view , but what I hear is a sl@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yan@@ ked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__zh-cn__ Can we roll the video ?
__zh-cn__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__zh-cn__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__zh-cn__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scrip@@ ting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__zh-cn__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__zh-cn__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are tes@@ ticles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Hum@@ ane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Hum@@ ane Society .
__zh-cn__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb sque@@ al and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__zh-cn__ Mel@@ anie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrot@@ um .
__zh-cn__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , sha@@ kes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__zh-cn__ G@@ ets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s qui@@ vering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__zh-cn__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__zh-cn__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ ancing around , bleeding stopped .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ bbling on some grass , fro@@ licking .
__zh-cn__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__zh-cn__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lam@@ bs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Mel@@ anie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__zh-cn__ Albert hands me the knife .
__zh-cn__ I go in , tail comes off .
__zh-cn__ I go in , I grab the scrot@@ um , tip comes off .
__zh-cn__ Albert instruc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ ush it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__zh-cn__ &quot; P@@ ush it further . &quot;
__zh-cn__ I do .
__zh-cn__ The tes@@ ticles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ite &apos; em .
__zh-cn__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__zh-cn__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Roc@@ kies , and all I can think of is the Aristot@@ elian definition of a tragedy .
__zh-cn__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jac@@ ke@@ d-up metaphor ?
__zh-cn__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__zh-cn__ I went in and I took them .
__zh-cn__ I took them like this , and I yan@@ ked my face back .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m standing there with two tes@@ ticles on my chin .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__zh-cn__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my class@@ ics professor in college drilled them there .
__zh-cn__ And they are anag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
__zh-cn__ An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
__zh-cn__ An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Greek word for discovery .
__zh-cn__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anag@@ nor@@ is@@ is .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anag@@ nor@@ ises every single day .
__zh-cn__ Great .
__zh-cn__ The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — E@@ uri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ opho@@ cles — the moment where O@@ edi@@ pus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s peri@@ pe@@ ty or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
__zh-cn__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ peti@@ a on my chin .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__zh-cn__ When you start to look for peri@@ peti@@ a , you find it everywhere .
__zh-cn__ I mean , Bruce Will@@ is in &quot; &quot; The Six@@ th Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__zh-cn__ Sp@@ ends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peri@@ peti@@ a .
__zh-cn__ You know ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__zh-cn__ Ne@@ o in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__zh-cn__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__zh-cn__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just de@@ filed — but it looked OK .
__zh-cn__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peri@@ pat@@ etic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__zh-cn__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__zh-cn__ And I talk to him .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__zh-cn__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__zh-cn__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of r@@ ye , dri@@ bbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__zh-cn__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__zh-cn__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , tes@@ ticles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__zh-cn__ And , after that shoot , D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__zh-cn__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__zh-cn__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are s@@ acr@@ os@@ anc@@ t , and they &apos;re not .
__zh-cn__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__zh-cn__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__zh-cn__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Lab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__zh-cn__ Ro@@ ad@@ kill pick@@ er-@@ up@@ pers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__zh-cn__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__zh-cn__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__zh-cn__ Fol@@ low your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__zh-cn__ Fol@@ low your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__zh-cn__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__zh-cn__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Com@@ bs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the un@@ eaten scr@@ aps of food from the cas@@ inos and feeds them them to his swine .
__zh-cn__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__zh-cn__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__zh-cn__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__zh-cn__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__zh-cn__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__zh-cn__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__zh-cn__ And I hear that story over and over .
__zh-cn__ Matt Fro@@ ind , a dairy farmer in New Cana@@ an , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__zh-cn__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__zh-cn__ Fol@@ low his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__zh-cn__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__zh-cn__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those pla@@ titudes they call &quot; &quot; success@@ ories &quot; &quot; that hang with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ zy art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now .
__zh-cn__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__zh-cn__ Safety — safety first ?
__zh-cn__ Going back to , you know , O@@ S@@ HA and PE@@ TA and the Hum@@ ane Society : what if O@@ S@@ HA got it wrong ?
__zh-cn__ I mean — this is her@@ esy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__zh-cn__ Right ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__zh-cn__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__zh-cn__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the B@@ ering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ liest C@@ atch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-@@ foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheel@@ house , right ?
__zh-cn__ Most haz@@ ard@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ ashing the pots down .
__zh-cn__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__zh-cn__ Un@@ spea@@ kably dangerous .
__zh-cn__ I scam@@ per down , I go into the wheel@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ dul@@ ity , &quot; Captain , O@@ S@@ HA . &quot;
__zh-cn__ And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ HA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__zh-cn__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__zh-cn__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__zh-cn__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__zh-cn__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__zh-cn__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__zh-cn__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__zh-cn__ Any@@ how , a whole lot of things .
__zh-cn__ I could talk at length about the many little distinc@@ tions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__zh-cn__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__zh-cn__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__zh-cn__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__zh-cn__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some M@@ achi@@ a@@ vel@@ lian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__zh-cn__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s lau@@ g@@ hable .
__zh-cn__ If there &apos;s a pl@@ umber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Ad@@ mit it .
__zh-cn__ You see him all the time .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what plum@@ bers look like , right ?
__zh-cn__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__zh-cn__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__zh-cn__ But , we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on Madison Avenue .
__zh-cn__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__zh-cn__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__zh-cn__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__zh-cn__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__zh-cn__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__zh-cn__ How many people have their Black@@ berries ?
__zh-cn__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__zh-cn__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__zh-cn__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__zh-cn__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__zh-cn__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__zh-cn__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__zh-cn__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__zh-cn__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like sho@@ vels and picks .
__zh-cn__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__zh-cn__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this margin@@ alization of lots and lots of jobs .
__zh-cn__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__zh-cn__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the tes@@ ticles on my chin .
__zh-cn__ I got a lot wrong .
__zh-cn__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__zh-cn__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__zh-cn__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__zh-cn__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__zh-cn__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__zh-cn__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-@@ school en@@ roll@@ ments are the second one .
__zh-cn__ Every single year : fewer electr@@ icians , fewer carpen@@ ters , fewer plum@@ bers , fewer wel@@ ders , fewer pi@@ pe@@ fit@@ ters , fewer ste@@ am@@ fit@@ ters .
__zh-cn__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__zh-cn__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engine@@ ers — that we need to exp@@ end to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__zh-cn__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__zh-cn__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t oppos@@ ites .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peri@@ peti@@ a and anag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ vering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__zh-cn__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
__zh-cn__ of sle@@ ep@@ -@@ deprived women .
__zh-cn__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__zh-cn__ Two-@@ and-a-half years ago , I fain@@ ted from exhaus@@ tion .
__zh-cn__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my chee@@ k@@ bone , I got five stit@@ ches on my right eye .
__zh-cn__ And I began the journey of re@@ discovering the value of sleep .
__zh-cn__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__zh-cn__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a vir@@ ility symbol .
__zh-cn__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bra@@ gged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__zh-cn__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__zh-cn__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship .
__zh-cn__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__zh-cn__ So a high I.Q.
__zh-cn__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__zh-cn__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Tit@@ an@@ ics .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ hman Brothers was Le@@ hman Brothers and Sist@@ ers , they might still be around .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper@@ -connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven@@ -and-@@ a-@@ half@@ - or eight-@@ hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__zh-cn__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__zh-cn__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__zh-cn__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this en@@ tails .
__zh-cn__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-@@ pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of inter@@ stellar space .
__zh-cn__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__zh-cn__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy gra@@ il of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__zh-cn__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wis@@ ps of prot@@ op@@ las@@ m , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__zh-cn__ How does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__zh-cn__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__zh-cn__ What then happens is not an acr@@ os@@ s-@@ the-@@ board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of bl@@ unting of your cognitive ability .
__zh-cn__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asser@@ ting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in medi@@ ating that function .
__zh-cn__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__zh-cn__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__zh-cn__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__zh-cn__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__zh-cn__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__zh-cn__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , par@@ i@@ etal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__zh-cn__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__zh-cn__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__zh-cn__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__zh-cn__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__zh-cn__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus .
__zh-cn__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logists .
__zh-cn__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly luc@@ id and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__zh-cn__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Fre@@ u@@ dian view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__zh-cn__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__zh-cn__ This is the so-called O@@ edi@@ pus complex of Freud .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Fre@@ u@@ dian view .
__zh-cn__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual ur@@ ges towards your mother .
__zh-cn__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__zh-cn__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual ur@@ ges to emerge , fl@@ aming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ explic@@ ably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__zh-cn__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__zh-cn__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Fre@@ u@@ dian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poo@@ dle . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fif@@ i . It looks exactly like Fif@@ i , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__zh-cn__ Now , you try using the Fre@@ u@@ dian explanation there .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent b@@ esti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__zh-cn__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__zh-cn__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__zh-cn__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eye@@ balls , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__zh-cn__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__zh-cn__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__zh-cn__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__zh-cn__ I talked about that earlier .
__zh-cn__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__zh-cn__ But from that area , the message casc@@ ades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gau@@ ges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__zh-cn__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__zh-cn__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__zh-cn__ Which you can completely ignore .
__zh-cn__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the auton@@ omic nervous system .
__zh-cn__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__zh-cn__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exer@@ tion .
__zh-cn__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__zh-cn__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__zh-cn__ So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus , and you recognize it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__zh-cn__ And then the message casc@@ ades into the amygdala , and then goes down the auton@@ omic nervous system .
__zh-cn__ But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__zh-cn__ So because the f@@ usi@@ form is intact , the cha@@ p can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this in@@ explic@@ able lack of emotions ?
__zh-cn__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__zh-cn__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your gal@@ v@@ anic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__zh-cn__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pin@@ up , you start sweating , right ?
__zh-cn__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__zh-cn__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__zh-cn__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his gal@@ v@@ anic skin response .
__zh-cn__ T@@ ables and chairs and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ anic skin response is flat .
__zh-cn__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__zh-cn__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly in@@ comprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Fre@@ u@@ dian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__zh-cn__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__zh-cn__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__zh-cn__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__zh-cn__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__zh-cn__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__zh-cn__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor .
__zh-cn__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__zh-cn__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__zh-cn__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__zh-cn__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__zh-cn__ When an arm is amp@@ ut@@ ated , or a leg is amp@@ ut@@ ated , for gan@@ gr@@ ene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__zh-cn__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__zh-cn__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscer@@ a .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uter@@ us removed — hyster@@ ectomy — who have a phantom uter@@ us , including phantom menstrual cram@@ ps at the appropriate time of the month .
__zh-cn__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific en@@ qu@@ iry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__zh-cn__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__zh-cn__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__zh-cn__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__zh-cn__ The patient &apos;s not del@@ usi@@ onal .
__zh-cn__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__zh-cn__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__zh-cn__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s fixed in a cl@@ enched sp@@ asm and it &apos;s excruci@@ at@@ ingly painful .
__zh-cn__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__zh-cn__ It sounds like an oxy@@ moron .
__zh-cn__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__zh-cn__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__zh-cn__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amp@@ ut@@ ates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__zh-cn__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__zh-cn__ Patients become depressed .
__zh-cn__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__zh-cn__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__zh-cn__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__zh-cn__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__zh-cn__ Why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__zh-cn__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__zh-cn__ The brain learns , because of this He@@ b@@ bian , associ@@ ative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__zh-cn__ And then , when you &apos;ve amp@@ ut@@ ated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__zh-cn__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__zh-cn__ How do you un@@ learn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ asm of the phantom arm ?
__zh-cn__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obe@@ ying his command , right ?
__zh-cn__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cram@@ p .
__zh-cn__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__zh-cn__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__zh-cn__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__zh-cn__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__zh-cn__ He had his arm amp@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
__zh-cn__ He had a br@@ achi@@ al av@@ ulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amp@@ ut@@ ated .
__zh-cn__ He had a phantom arm , excruci@@ at@@ ingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__zh-cn__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__zh-cn__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__zh-cn__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is cl@@ enched and in sp@@ asm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the cl@@ enched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__zh-cn__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__zh-cn__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ asm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ ggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__zh-cn__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__zh-cn__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__zh-cn__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__zh-cn__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__zh-cn__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ enched again . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__zh-cn__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__zh-cn__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__zh-cn__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dy@@ st@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__zh-cn__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__zh-cn__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , un@@ learn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__zh-cn__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__zh-cn__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no phantom fore@@ arm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__zh-cn__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__zh-cn__ Now , why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__zh-cn__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no propri@@ o@@ ception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__zh-cn__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__zh-cn__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__zh-cn__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__zh-cn__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__zh-cn__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__zh-cn__ St@@ ro@@ ke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__zh-cn__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__zh-cn__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__zh-cn__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ This was discovered by Francis Gal@@ ton in the n@@ ine@@ teenth century .
__zh-cn__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__zh-cn__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following pecu@@ li@@ arity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__zh-cn__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , nine is indi@@ go , OK ?
__zh-cn__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__zh-cn__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__zh-cn__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__zh-cn__ Why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ This is called synesthesia . Gal@@ ton called it synesthesia , a ming@@ ling of the senses .
__zh-cn__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__zh-cn__ These people mu@@ ddle up their senses .
__zh-cn__ Why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__zh-cn__ Sy@@ nes@@ the@@ sia runs in families , so Gal@@ ton said this is a hered@@ itary basis , a genetic basis .
__zh-cn__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__zh-cn__ Why would that be ?
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__zh-cn__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__zh-cn__ Well , there are many theories .
__zh-cn__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__zh-cn__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__zh-cn__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?
__zh-cn__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__zh-cn__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus .
__zh-cn__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__zh-cn__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__zh-cn__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__zh-cn__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__zh-cn__ That gives you the clue .
__zh-cn__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__zh-cn__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__zh-cn__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__zh-cn__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gene mutates , then you get defici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between adjacent brain areas .
__zh-cn__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number@@ -col@@ or synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get ton@@ e@@ -col@@ or synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ So far , so good .
__zh-cn__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross@@ -connected ?
__zh-cn__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , schizophren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__zh-cn__ Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__zh-cn__ In@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__zh-cn__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__zh-cn__ OK , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ological view of synesthesia .
__zh-cn__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ esthe@@ tes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__zh-cn__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__zh-cn__ Different shapes for different phon@@ emes , right ?
__zh-cn__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__zh-cn__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__zh-cn__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__zh-cn__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__zh-cn__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__zh-cn__ Ninety-@@ nine percent of you .
__zh-cn__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-@@ model syn@@ esthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that j@@ agged shape .
__zh-cn__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the f@@ usi@@ form gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__zh-cn__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glit@@ ters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__zh-cn__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__zh-cn__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__zh-cn__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__zh-cn__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__zh-cn__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter )
__zh-cn__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__zh-cn__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fish@@ net , used the same way for centuries .
__zh-cn__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , bil@@ lowing , vol@@ up@@ tuous forms the scale of hard-@@ ed@@ ged buildings in cities around the world .
__zh-cn__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__zh-cn__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__zh-cn__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__zh-cn__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__zh-cn__ Prom@@ ising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Maha@@ b@@ ali@@ pur@@ am .
__zh-cn__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__zh-cn__ I had to do something .
__zh-cn__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__zh-cn__ So I tried bronze casting .
__zh-cn__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__zh-cn__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volu@@ metric form without heavy solid materials .
__zh-cn__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hi@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoist@@ ed them on poles to photograph .
__zh-cn__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__zh-cn__ I was mesmer@@ ized .
__zh-cn__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artis@@ ans , next in Li@@ thu@@ ania with l@@ ace makers .
__zh-cn__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__zh-cn__ Re@@ turning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-@@ tied knots — installed briefly in Mad@@ rid .
__zh-cn__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urban@@ ist Man@@ ual Sol@@ a-@@ Mor@@ ales who was redesigning the waterfront in Por@@ to , Portugal .
__zh-cn__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__zh-cn__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__zh-cn__ D@@ urable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyn@@ cratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__zh-cn__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move flu@@ idly in the wind .
__zh-cn__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__zh-cn__ So we raised this 4@@ 5,000-@@ pound steel ring .
__zh-cn__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__zh-cn__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__zh-cn__ I found a brilliant aeronau@@ tical engineer who designs sa@@ ils for America &apos;s Cup racing yach@@ ts named Peter H@@ ep@@ pel .
__zh-cn__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__zh-cn__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-@@ tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__zh-cn__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fish@@ net factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make l@@ ace with them .
__zh-cn__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyn@@ cratic hand@@ craft into something machine operators could produce .
__zh-cn__ So we had to create one .
__zh-cn__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50@@ ,000-@@ square-foot l@@ ace net .
__zh-cn__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bl@@ and and anonymous .
__zh-cn__ Now it had a sense of place .
__zh-cn__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__zh-cn__ As I watched the wind &apos;s chore@@ ography unfold , I felt shel@@ tered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__zh-cn__ My life was not going to be the same .
__zh-cn__ I want to create these o@@ ases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__zh-cn__ Hi@@ stor@@ ic Philadelphia City Hall : its pl@@ aza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than ne@@ tting .
__zh-cn__ So we experimented with tiny atom@@ ized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__zh-cn__ Next challenge , the Bi@@ ennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__zh-cn__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__zh-cn__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rip@@ pled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__zh-cn__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shor@@ tened the length of the day .
__zh-cn__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__zh-cn__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.@@ 26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ tened .
__zh-cn__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__zh-cn__ Its shape was too complex now .
__zh-cn__ So I replaced the metal ar@@ mature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__zh-cn__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__zh-cn__ There was no software that could ex@@ trude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__zh-cn__ So we had to create it .
__zh-cn__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__zh-cn__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__zh-cn__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__zh-cn__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__zh-cn__ Now I combine them with hi@@ -@@ tech materials and engineering to create vol@@ up@@ tuous , bil@@ lowing forms the scale of buildings .
__zh-cn__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__zh-cn__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__zh-cn__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__zh-cn__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__zh-cn__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the re@@ discovery of wonder .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__zh-cn__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__zh-cn__ She &apos;s a six-@@ mon@@ ther .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ So when I was a kid ...
__zh-cn__ So it makes sense that we &apos;ve headed in this direction .
__zh-cn__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__zh-cn__ Many people don &apos;t know this but tuna are war@@ m-@@ blooded .
__zh-cn__ There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut .
__zh-cn__ Because the byproducts of chickens — feathers , blood , bone — get ground up and fed to fish .
__zh-cn__ It &apos;s sort of a re@@ working of the chicken and egg thing . Anyway — ( Laughter ) All together , though , it results in a terrible mess .
__zh-cn__ What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
__zh-cn__ That &apos;s the equivalent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the sea each and every year .
__zh-cn__ The last of the four is a kind of amorph@@ ous thing .
__zh-cn__ Unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .
__zh-cn__ Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents , so he turned to Atlantic cod .
__zh-cn__ We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England .
__zh-cn__ So now the Fil@@ et@@ -@@ O-@@ Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pol@@ lock , it &apos;s the largest fin fish fishery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year .
__zh-cn__ If we go through the pol@@ lock , the next choice is probably going to be til@@ ap@@ ia .
__zh-cn__ Til@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago .
__zh-cn__ So what do we do ?
__zh-cn__ I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the clu@@ pe@@ ids ?
__zh-cn__ The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons .
__zh-cn__ So that is a potential .
__zh-cn__ And if we were to go down that route what I would say is , instead of paying a few bucks a pound — or a few bucks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qua@@ feed , could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish ?
__zh-cn__ Other possibility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ valves , particularly mus@@ sels .
__zh-cn__ Now , mus@@ sels are very high in EPA and D@@ HA , they &apos;re similar to can@@ ned tuna .
__zh-cn__ They &apos;re also extremely fuel efficient .
__zh-cn__ To bring a pound of mus@@ sels to market is about a thir@@ ti@@ eth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market .
__zh-cn__ They require no forage fish , they actually get their ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by filtering the water of microalgae .
__zh-cn__ In fact , that &apos;s where ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish .
__zh-cn__ Micro@@ algae make the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bio@@ concentrated in fish .
__zh-cn__ And this is incredibly important when we look at the world .
__zh-cn__ Right now , nit@@ ri@@ fication , over@@ use of phosph@@ ates in our waterways are causing tremendous alg@@ al blooms .
__zh-cn__ Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years , tremendous sources of marine life death .
__zh-cn__ We also could look at not a fish at all .
__zh-cn__ They filter the water just like mus@@ sels do .
__zh-cn__ And weir@@ dly enough , it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows .
__zh-cn__ Now , I &apos;m not a big fan of cattle .
__zh-cn__ But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited , you &apos;re growing seaweed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — major consideration .
__zh-cn__ And the last fish is a question mark .
__zh-cn__ This exists kind of on paper .
__zh-cn__ I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years .
__zh-cn__ It is time to scale this up .
__zh-cn__ If we do , 30 million metric tons of seafood , a third of the world catch , stays in the water .
__zh-cn__ So I guess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
__zh-cn__ We tend to go with our appeti@@ tes rather than our minds .
__zh-cn__ Thank you .
__zh-cn__ ( Applause )
__zh-cn__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__zh-cn__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__zh-cn__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__zh-cn__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous coll@@ age of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__zh-cn__ I am an energy-@@ being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__zh-cn__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__zh-cn__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__zh-cn__ Our left hemisphere thinks lin@@ early and metho@@ dically .
__zh-cn__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__zh-cn__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__zh-cn__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__zh-cn__ And I felt lighter in my body .
